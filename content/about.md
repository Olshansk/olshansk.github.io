**Where am I from?**: Born in 🇷🇺, grew up in 🇮🇱, and spent my formative years 🇨🇦 before moving to the 🇺🇸 to pursue my professional career.

**Who am I?**: I'm a life-long 🧑‍🎓 looking to leave an impactful mark on this 🌎 through deep thinking 🤔, hard work 👷, collaboration and technological innovation 🧑‍🔬. Standing on the shoulders of giants such [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), amongst many others, I'm increasingly motivated that we have such individuals in our world.

**Where do I work?**: I studied at the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto. After doing 📱 at Twitter, 🤖 at Google, and helping build a few services, including Gif Search, at Twitter, I spent a handful of years at Magic Leap building out a digital sharable world enabling cross-reality experiences. After that, I spent a couple of years at Waymo working on autonomous vehicles and building out data science infrastructure for the Planner Eval team. Currently, I'm leading the protocol team at Pocket Network, a Blockchain Protocol.

**What do I do in my spare time?**: In my spare time, I'm either at the gym experimenting with a new workout 🏋🏽, enjoying the outdoors in some fashion 🥾🌲⛰ , reading or tinkering on something new 📚✍️, or just having fun at an improv class 🃏.
