## Hey, I’m Daniel, and I usually go by Olshansky

I live by a few mantras:

1. Figure out what you _want-to do_ instead of what you _want-to want-to do_. **Now do it**.
2. Learn your limit, push yourself to the limit, up your limit. Rinse and repeat.
3. Live in a way such that your future self inspires your present self.
4. Experience is building a toolbox, expertise is mastering each tool, and leadership is knowing which tool to use when.
5. Strive to create generational impact while staying kind to the people around you.

## Where am I from?

Born in 🇷🇺 Moscow, grew up in 🇮🇱, and spent my formative years in 🇨🇦 before moving to the 🇺🇸 to pursue my career.

I'm not a nomad, but I do move around a lot, so I'd classify my nationality as a North American Russian Jew.

That said, I connect with people and ideas rather than geographies or backgrounds.

## What drives me?

I’m a lifelong learner 🧑‍🎓 with a goal of creating a generational brand with global impacts.

Founders and generational companies inspire me to do my best work, and I need to do the same for future generations.

How do we do it? Technological innovation, hard work, operational excellence, while cultivating environments that push and enable individuals to do their best work.

## Where did I work?

I've worked across social, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, crypto, and large-scale systems.

None of it has (yet) moved the needle on a global scale, but I’m proud of the work and the teams I’ve been part of.

- 2010 - 2014: **University of Toronto**; Engineering Science; _NΨ 1T4_
- 2014 - 2015: **Twitter**; I worked on 📱 and shipped things like Gif Search. I learnt how big corporations operate and what it means to design systems.
- 2016 - 2020: **Magic Leap**; I helped build a shareable digital world for cross-reality experiences. I learnt how to navigate politics, what too much premature money can do, and how to innovate on the technical front.
- 2020 - 2022: **Waymo**; I built data science infrastructure for the Planner Eval team. I built intuition around AI, ML, evals and how the smartest people in the world think.
- 2021 - 2022: **GetSoils**; I built a construction soil marketplace. I learnt how hard it is to sell to old industries.
- 2022 - Present: **Grove** & **Pocket Network**; I led a small team and a large ecosystem in the R&D of a blockchain that enables decentralized access to data and API discovery. I learnt that EQ is much more important than IQ when it comes to leadership.

## What do I value?

I believe in **mind-body connection**. Training, reflection, writing, building—these are all forms of the same pursuit. I hold myself and others to high standards, sometimes too high. My weaknesses are clear to me: I burn out, I’m impatient, and I can struggle with EQ. But I try to balance that by being kind, even when I’m not “nice.”

The things that bother me most: **laziness, incompetence, lack of appreciation, lack of humility.**

## Who inspires me?

The individual who continues to show me, day in and day out, that there are no
bounds to what one can do is **Rahul Goel**, founder of NordSpace. I'm privelaged
to call him a friend. Whatever you dream, you can do. It won't be easy, it'll take
time, it'll be painful, but there is no limit.

If I could spend a month working with anyone, it would be **Tobias Lütke**, CEO of Shopify.
If I could have dinner with anyone, it would be **Peter Thiel**.

Other people I learn from and who inspire me on a regular basis:

- **Dharmesh Shah** — CTO of Shopify
- **John Carmack** — legendary programmer and game developer
- **Andrej Karpathy** — AI researcher
- **Vitalik Buterin** — founder of Ethereum
- **Mitchell Hashimoto** — creator of HashiCorp
- **Simon Willison** — co-creator of Django, thoughtful builder
- **Stephen Wolfram** — founder of Wolfram Research
- **Edward Thorp** — mathematician, investor, and blackjack pioneer
- **Richard Feynman** — physicist, teacher, storyteller

I don’t put any of these people on a pedestal—they’re human, flawed, but deeply impactful.
I study them because they’ve carved unique paths, thought differently, and created enduring value.

## What do I do in my spare time?

- Go to the gym focusing on movement 🏋🏽🤸💪
- Spend time outdoors on short hikes and lakesides 🥾🌲⛰🏊🌊
- Reading and writing 📚✍️
- Tinkering and experiments 🤓👨‍💻
- Calls and walks 📞🚶
- Long dinner conversations 🍽🗣
- Periodically networking at events 🤝
- Watching Movies & TV shows

What do I want to do more of:

- Take part in improv classes 🎭
- Go to comedy clubs 🎤
- Work on new physical skills 🤹
- Podcasting 🎙
- Reflecting 📝
- Meditating 🧘
- Executing on my next big idea ⚡
