I'm a life-long learner looking to leave an impactful mark on this ðŸŒŽ through deep thinking, hard work, collaboration and technological innovation. Standing on the shoulders of giants such John Carmack, Stephen Wolfram and Richard Feynman, amongst many others, I'm increasingly motivated that we have such individuals in our world.

I studied at the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto. After doing iOS at Twitter, Android at Google, and helping build a few services, including Gif Search, at Twitter, I spent a handful of years at Magic Leap building out a digital sharable world enabling cross-reality experiences. After that, I spent a couple of years at Waymo building out data science infrastructure for the Planner Eval team and am currently managing the protocol team at Pocket Network.

In my spare time, I'm either at the gym experimenting with a new workout, enjoying the outdoors in some fashion, reading or tinkering on something new, or just having fun at an improv class.
