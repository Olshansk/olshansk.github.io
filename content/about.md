**Where am I from?** Born in 🇷🇺, grew up in 🇮🇱, and spent my formative years 🇨🇦 before moving to the 🇺🇸 to pursue my professional career.

**Who am I?** I'm a life-long 🧑‍🎓 looking to leave an impactful mark on this 🌎 through deep thinking 🤔, hard work 👷, collaboration and technological innovation 🧑‍🔬. Standing on the shoulders of giants such [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), amongst many others, I'm increasingly motivated that we have such individuals in our world.

**What's my motto?** Figure out what you want-to-do instead of what you want-to want-to-do. Then, there's no limit to what's possible by taking a first principles approach supported by deep thinking, hard work, writing and reflection.

**Where do I work?** I studied at the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto. After doing 📱 at Twitter, 🤖 at Google, and helping build a few services, including Gif Search, at Twitter, I spent a handful of years at Magic Leap building out a digital sharable world enabling cross-reality experiences. After that, I spent a couple of years at Waymo working on autonomous vehicles and building out data science infrastructure for the Planner Eval team. Currently, I'm leading the protocol team at Pocket Network, a Blockchain Protocol. Find out more on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolshansky/) or [cv](/pdfs/resume.pdf).

**What do I do in my spare time?** In my spare time, I'm either at the gym experimenting with a new workout 🏋🏽, enjoying the outdoors in some fashion 🥾🌲⛰ , reading or tinkering on something new 📚✍️, or just having fun at an improv class 🃏.
