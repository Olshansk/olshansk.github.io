## Hey, I’m Daniel, though I usually go by Olshansky

I live by a few mantras:

1. Figure out what you _want-to do_ instead of what you _want-to want-to do_. **Now do it**.
2. Learn your limit, push yourself to the limit, up your limit, rinse and repeat.
3. Strive to create generational impact while staying kind to the people around you.

## Where am I from?

Born in 🇷🇺 Moscow, grew up in 🇮🇱, and spent my formative years in 🇨🇦 before moving to the 🇺🇸 to pursue my career.

I'm not a nomad, but I do move around a lot, so I'd classify my Nationality as a North American Russian Jew.

That said, I prefer to connect with people and ideas rather than geographies or backgrounds.

### Who am I?

I’m a lifelong learner 🧑‍🎓 who is working on building generational impact on the world 🌎 through technological innovation,
hard work, operational execution, while cultivating environments that push and enable individuals to do their best work.

### Where did I work?

I don’t associate myself with any single domain. I’ve built things in augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, crypto, and large-scale systems. None of it has (yet) moved the needle on a global scale, but I’m proud of the work and the teams I’ve been part of. My mission is simple:
**Achieve my full potential, then find a way to enable anyone else who wants to.**

I studied in the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto.

- At **Twitter**, I worked on 📱 and shipped things like Gif Search.
- At **Google**, I spent time in robotics 🤖.
- At **Magic Leap**, I helped build a shareable digital world for cross-reality experiences.
- At **Waymo**, I built data science infrastructure for the Planner Eval team, helping autonomous vehicles understand the world.
- Today, I’m the **CTO of Grove**, leading the engineering behind [Pocket Network](https://www.pokt.network), a blockchain protocol for decentralized access to data.

You can find the professional version of this story on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolshansky/) or in my [CV](/pdfs/resume.pdf).

## Who am I inspired by?

I admire people like [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram), and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman). Standing on the shoulders of giants, I want to see the room—but I want to run it first.

### What do I value?

I believe in **mind-body connection**. Training, reflection, writing, building—these are all forms of the same pursuit. I hold myself and others to high standards, sometimes too high. My weaknesses are clear to me: I burn out, I’m impatient, and I can struggle with EQ. But I try to balance that by being kind, even when I’m not “nice.”

The things that bother me most: **laziness, incompetence, lack of appreciation, lack of humility.**

### What do I do in my spare time?

- Gym experiments 🏋🏽
- Hiking and outdoors 🥾🌲⛰
- Reading and tinkering 📚✍️
- Improv classes 🎭
- Writing blogs and reflections 📝
- Dreaming up the next startup ⚡

Sometimes, I just enjoy a laugh with friends, or record a podcast. Day-to-day, I like my life: work, gym, learning, friends, my team. The only things missing: enough capital to retire my family, and a partner to share it all with.
