**Where am I from?** Born in 🇷🇺, grew up in 🇮🇱, and spent my formative years 🇨🇦 before moving to the 🇺🇸 to pursue my professional career.

**Who am I?** I'm a life-long 🧑‍🎓 looking to leave an impactful mark on this 🌎 through deep thinking 🤔, hard work 👷, collaboration and technological innovation 🧑‍🔬. Standing on the shoulders of giants such [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), amongst many others, I'm increasingly motivated that we have such individuals in our world.

**What's my motto?** Figure out what you want-to-do instead of what you want-to want-to-do. Then, there's no limit to what's possible by taking a first principles approach supported by deep thinking, hard work, writing and reflection.

**Where do I work?** I studied at the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto. After doing 📱 at Twitter, 🤖 at Google, and helping build a few services, including Gif Search, at Twitter, I spent a handful of years at Magic Leap building out a digital sharable world enabling cross-reality experiences. After that, I spent a couple of years at Waymo working on autonomous vehicles and building out data science infrastructure for the Planner Eval team. Currently, I'm leading the protocol team at Pocket Network, a Blockchain Protocol. Find out more on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolshansky/) or [cv](/pdfs/resume.pdf).

**What do I do in my spare time?** In my spare time, I'm either at the gym experimenting with a new workout 🏋🏽, enjoying the outdoors in some fashion 🥾🌲⛰ , reading or tinkering on something new 📚✍️, or just having fun at an improv class 🃏.

Hey, I’m Daniel.

A Russian Jew, who is born in Moscow move to most. Of work at google Twitter, magically Lamo and out here at Grove, but don’t think I’ve done anything with value yet.

Between my sleep, gym, learning my hobbies, my team, etc. friends I really like my day-to-day life. The only thing that’s missing is the capital to retire my family. The capital can never be limited and a partner with kids to share with.

I don’t associate myself with any single domain, because I think that anything can be learned. I believe I’ve done good work in the fields of vehicles, augment, reality, crypto and systems, but by no means, move the needle on global scale.

My biggest weaknesses are being pro pro to burnout, being very portable of incompetent, having education, education of others, as I do myself, and my level.

I’m still figuring out how I wanna keep track of things I read and links and notes, and they’re all spread across notion, obsidian, raindrop, to do list, get Pocket good from tomatoes Twitter I wonder. Most popular Opinion I genuinely care and plan to become a billionaire. Not just if you have the freedom of the plane capital how inappropriate, But because it all prove that I created a real value, and it will be the moment when I deserve to start interacting with the in this world, will try tries to future of humanity and civilization. I want to see the room, but I want to run it first.

I believe that only anyone can anything as long as I figure out what they want to do what they want to do.

My biggest belief is that training is a mind, body connection and everyone of us. Once something like never mind becomes more mature I’ll be an opportunity to go to Product, but it’s too early. Someone who found the inside of the mini I also believe there will be value here, some sort of global level revolution. I don’t know when that happened a year or 100.

The biggest weakness is my introverted, my expectation of others to be as as myself, And my inability to tolerate and competence.
I’m very aware through the world,

I’m very aware of relationship through the world and that kindness is an under of a superpower to succeed, but I’m working on it.

My new, no bullshit about the page

I don’t associate myself with any specific to me

If I had to summarize my life mission and one sentence, it would be to achieve my full potential, then find a way to enable anyone else (who wants to). For example, need an NBA player. It’s probably not my potential, when a price is being a good father, hopefully, being a father yes. I think the secret lies in the mind, but I’m still working on myself in this

Intersect and probably the next


I built some cool data 11 pipe Ron, build some ahead of its time for the types I won’t be able to magically some fun features at Twitter like for search, and made some cool tutorial videos don’t create anything yet
