Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Another season, and another step closer to connecting with the characters and their story.

I continue to dislike Sol & Robert, as their relationship just feels unauthentic, but everyone is absolutely amazing.

The show has a real "Modern Family" vibe to it, but shows that age is not a limit to anything. Ambition, excitement, love and friendship are all timeless and can be found at any age.
