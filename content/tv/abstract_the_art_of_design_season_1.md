Episode 1: A new unique show that really show the other side of something I've never seen before. I can tell how difficult it was for both the artist and director to figure out how to fill an hour, but every moment still managed to be unique, moving and inspirational. Utterly amazing!

Episode 4: This episode was VERY INTERSTING BUT I DID FIND IT BORING AT TIMES. I really admire BJARKE and how he's changing architecture and was surprised to learn how out of the box some architects think. This provided me with a perspective iI had never come across before.
