Easily, easily, easily the best show I've seen in years.

I want to say that I "ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT", but that's not enough.

I'm "overwhelmed", in the best sense of the word, by how good the show is.
It's sheer (mad?) creativity, originality, and genius that's unparalleled.

The cinematography was jaw-dropping, the music was just perfect, the writing
was unlike anything I've ever seen before, and when I reminded myself that the people
on the screen were actors, I just couldn't believe it.

Up until the last 20 minutes of the last episode, I had absolutely no clue how
things were going to end. I made a prediction, and it turned out to be absolutely
wrong. The fact that I was 7.5 episodes into a limited series and had no clue
speaks volumes of the show itself.

There's an opportunity for a second season. If Netflix releases it, I'll be very
excited and absolutely watch it. If there won't be one, I'll also be very happy with how
things ended.

I like to think that I could, with enough time and creative juices, come up with
most concepts I see in sci-fi books and fantasy novels. But in a million years,
I'd never be capable of doing this. What Charlie Covell (the creator of KAOS) and
her team did is unparalleled in my opinion.

If I had to summarize the plot / context, I'd call it a dark yet colorful,
twisted but clear, comedic yet gory, whimsical, mythological masterpiece.

Greek mythology meets the modern-day culture, blurring the lines between humans'
distrust in the gods, with the gods' selfishness, pettiness, self-interest,
greed and self-doubt being reflected back.

I loved how the underworld was portrayed as a real place, with its own rules,
laws, day-to-day life, physics, and beauty. It wasn't just a different world,
it was the underworld. The decision to make it grayscale added contrast with the
"real world", and was a nice touch.

Using 90s-style brick cellphones was also a brilliant idea. I feel like it'll make
the show very rewatchable because it has no attachment to the 2020s. The goal was
to have a dark mythological comedy meet modern-day, independent of the nuances.
Again, brilliant decision.

We often say that "Humans were made in the image of Gods", but this show proved it.
They weren't shiny, bigger, more beautiful, or anything else. The suspense of disbelief
was implicit and took nothing away from the fantasy. The balance between humans,
gods, prophets or fates sways back and forth under one large roof.

I won't go into the details of every show or character. I'll simply say that this
is a must-watch and end it there.

Lastly, fun little fact.

When I started watching this show, I watched the first episode on my own and
then stopped immediately. My partner in crime when it comes to watching intriguing,
thought-provoking shows is my mom. We'd pause the show, discuss every episode,
and simply reflect by how amazing every moment of every scene was. This had both
of us in awe after every episode.
