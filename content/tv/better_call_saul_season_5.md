It's all good man!!

I'm continuously amazed at how great this show is. Every single season manages to give me more of what I'm looking for, but remain original, invigorating and exciting.

The one constant between every single season is the mood and feel that the directors create. The emptiness of the desert, the wide screen shots, as well the balance of Jimmy's humour, excitement, terror and failure. The cinematography is amazing, but I'm not at liberty to comment on it due to my lack of knowledge. I love watching the fight scenes, the shooting sequences, but also a car simply driving through the desert for hours on end. They're all visually appealing in different ways and set the mood in a very well calculated manner.

The difference between every season is how it is not repetitive at all. Some characters remain, others die, some are introduced, but it never gets dull. This is one of the few shows that has true character development, and it is fascinating to see the series of events that lead each of them to change.

I love Jimmy, Kim, Hamlin, Nacho, and Mike all in their own way. Currently. Currently, I'm most interested to see how Nacho is going to manage to survive Lalo's rampage, and what happens to Kim Wexler!
