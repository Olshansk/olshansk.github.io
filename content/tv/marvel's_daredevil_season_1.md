Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

While it's not the best show on TV, nor is it Netflix's strongest production, it is a very strong contender in the superhero series phenomena. I would place Daredevil midway between Arrow and Gotham, because it strays away from super cheesy and cliche hero genre, but is not quite as dark as Id expect the Daredevil to be.
