Dragon Ball Daima gives the fans what they want.

A fun, action packed, versatile story with all the characters we've learned to love,
a few new ones to keep things interesting, aesthetic transformation scenes, and backstories
that prevent it from feeling like "more of the same".

If you're a dragon ball fan, you should definitely watch it.
If not, I'm too biased to give any sort of critique.
