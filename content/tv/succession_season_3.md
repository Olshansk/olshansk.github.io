I don't have anything too insightful to add that add's to my review of season 2,
other than that it's more of the same, which is a very high bar to keep meeting
given how good the writing, cast and plot is.

Adding `Luka` as a key character was a great decision since it really brought
the show to the 21st century. THere was a small suspense of disbelief that millennials
keep pushing forward traditional media, but this made it feel real.

Seeing `Greg` really come out of his shell is nice comic relief, but there's isn't
mich to add.

`Ken`'s polarized character is something I can really relate to. Oscillating between
confidence, strength, blind loyalty, irrational fear, self-doubt, suicidal thoughts,
and then back to the strength of being in charge and changing the world hits home.

The character I feel the most compassion for is `Tom`. He's an insider who is on
the outside. He is there to serve but no one cares. He tries to be the best husband
he can for `Shiv`, but she just keeps pushing him away.

A fun fact I learn about `Roman`, is that he's played by the actor whose older
brother is the main character from Home Alone! On the off-chance he ever reads
this, he'll probably hate hearing it, but I intentionally avoided googling the
names I couldn't remember just to show how influential that movie was on society
and my personal upbringing. The fact that I'm excited about this fun fact speaks
for itself.
