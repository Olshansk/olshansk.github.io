Though the game felt very mundane, repetitive and boring, and though the series isn't necessarily a must-see, it is filled with plenty of surprises and interesting story arcs. I can't say there is real character development, but I like the characters as they are, their dynamics and am interested to see where it'll go next. Overall, it's a fantasy world, with magical creatures, some surprises and cool graphics. I'll keep watching it because it's entertaining.
