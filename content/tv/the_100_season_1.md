Episode 1: The first episode has set the stage for a very sci-fi-ish dystopian world, with a very permitting plot that can expand in various directions, and lots of room to, and lots of room to both introduce, kill of, and develop the characters introduced; all smothered with cheesy goodness.

Episodes 2 - 4: The show is getting heated, and it becomes increasingly difficult to determine who exactly are the main characters and what lies ahead. Alongside many hot-chick dorky-guy cliches, the show can be quite staggering in many ways; such as introducing a young girl that first kills and proceeds to take her own life. While there are many scientific loopholes, and the apathy exhibited by these children towards Earth after only having been there several days is unsatisfying, overlooking them unlocks a potentially very interesting underlying plot.

Episode 5: As the much anticipated love triangle begins to form, the writers surprised me by following through with the murder of the volunteers. While some characters are still very clearly immune, there may be more to this show than meets the eye.
