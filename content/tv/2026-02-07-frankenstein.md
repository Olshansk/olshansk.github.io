The film that will finally make people remember Frankenstein as a story of creation, reflection, and forgiveness, not of that of a monster.

I watched this film with my mom across 3 evenings over dinner.

The three parter was unintentional, but it fit the film surprisngly well. We had:

1. The intro
2. The story of Frankenstein
3. The story of the monster

The story was beautiful. The graphics were stunning. The acting itself was good, but not "oscar winning".
