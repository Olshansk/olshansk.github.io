One of the best shows that has gone under the radar and doesn't receive the press or credit it deserves.

A large and diverse group of main characters, who are telepathically interconnected in a very intriguing plot, have so much chemistry on screen. Every single character is unique and diverse in their own way, but it somehow all comes together. Every actor encompasses the backstory of whom they play that I connect with them on an emotional level. Even though there is an individual plot that everyone is facing, the transition to/from the overarching shared plot is very smooth and unforced. There are no fillers, superfluous fight scenes or unnecessary sex scenes; everything has a meaning.

The cinematography is out of this world. Ranging from slow beautiful scenic scenes to action filled hand-to-hand combat or bar shootouts, to exotic and emotional orgies, that I never wanted to take my eyes off the screen.

It's unfortunate that the show was cancelled after Season 2, but I loved every minute of the first two seasons.
