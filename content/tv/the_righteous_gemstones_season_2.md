I swiftly went through Season 2 and started Season 3 without even realizing it. That probably speaks for itself.

Is this a show I'd recommend to others? Probably not.
Is it my immediate goto when I want a deep high-quality show? No.
Is it something that deserves "high praise" or "high criticism"? No.
Am I enjoying it and plan to continue watching it? Absolutely.
