Rating: ⭐⭐⭐

I really like Paul Rudd, and the concept is pretty intriguing. However, this isn't the type of show that I would recommend to someone else, so I'll probably stop watching it myself.

Some shows (Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, etc...) are the reason you get a streaming service, while others are just fillers. This is a filler...
