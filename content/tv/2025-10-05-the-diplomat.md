Witty. Fun. Captivating. Entertaining. Thrilling. Brilliant. Exciting. Original

This show was exactly what I needed, and surprisingly a lot more relatable than
I ever anticipated.

I was scrolling through Netflix and HBO Max trying to decide what I should watch.

I already had a "Rom Com" pallet cleanse and needed something different.
Something real, but not too depressing.

This show shows what it means to be a diplomat. Politics are a part of the game.
Relationships rule the world. If you also execute alongside this, that's an unbeatable combo.

All the weaknesses Kate has are too close to home. From learning to be patient,
containing ones emotions, knowing which game you're playing, and adapting, is
exactly what I needed to see.
