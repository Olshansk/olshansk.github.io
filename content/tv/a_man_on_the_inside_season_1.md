Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

A light, fun, heart-warming show that still manages to surprise and reminds you
to appreciate the little things in life.

My mom and I picked up this show after watching "The Gentleman". The Gentleman is
an absolute masterpiece and likely in my top 5 shows of all time. But, I needed
a simple recovery show, but it needs to pass some base level quality.

This one hit all the spots: family friendly, engaging, familial, etc. A few characters
stood out, but a few felt really fake. Not going to get into the details, but I'll
definitely watch the second season, when I need a "recovery" from another top-tier show.
