Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

It was captivating, it was discomforting, it was real, it was confusing, it was
fun, it was raw. It was a story an individual had to tell, and no autobiography
could have done it justice.

I made it about halfway through the show before I realized that the show is a
true story, and that the main actor is the actual individual who went through
the entire experience.

Most shows the capture my attention to this degree are a result of seeing parts
of myself in the main characters. Though it's not the case here, I'm still
at a lost for words to describe the experience that Baby Reindeer is. You have
to watch it to understand.
