The first season was good, but did leave me craving for more. Alas, I was still looking forward to the second season and it was absolutely incredible! The plot, the acting, the graphics, the actors, the ideas, the suspense, all of it! Absolutely phenomenal and I can't believe I'll have to wait a year for the next one.

Hari Seldon, Gaal, Salvor, Dermezel and all three brothers were absolutely on point. The chemistry between them, the inner struggle, the outward confidence, the brilliance, the strength and the weaknesses were all perfectly balanced to create a world unlike any other. Nothing felt too cheesy, nor too forced, and it all fit into place. They somehow managed to fit intergalactic travel, a telepathic arc, some time travel, a couple love affairs and a revolution all into one season and it didn't feel like too much.

The drops of physics in the plot really fed to the scientists within me. The superposition of the prime radiant, the ideas of 4D objects having 3D shadows, and the balance of scientific advancement and religious beliefs were all so well done.

I genuinely can't wait for the next seasons, but I've got to say that the directors and actors have set a high bar for themselves!
