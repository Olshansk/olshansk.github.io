Episode 1: I think this show is going to make me develop a different type of appreciation for food and I'm looking forward to having that happen.

Episode 2: While everything was interesting and insightful, one very important thing was being overlooked. Growing food for uniformity, mass production, transportation and storage is what came with the industrial revolution at the turn of the century. This is primal in keeping costs down, keeping supply apply, and maintaining/promoting globalization. While I do agree that some portion of the population, such as that portrayed in the show, should look to push food to new limits through exquisiteness, uniqueness and health., it is very important to keep cost in mind.
