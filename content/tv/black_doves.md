It was a great Christmas themed thriller that took a few twists and turns I
didn't see coming. The story is alright, but it's the cast that makes it worth it.

Sam (the triggerman) was definitely my favorite. A few entrenched father issues,
a loyal friend, a loving ex, and one who tries to do the morally right thing in
every aspect of life. Somehow, however, doing the morally right thing at every
step along the way leads to him being in the wrong spot with blood on his hands.

Helen, the main character, was cool but very two dimensional. Felt like she had
no development, no depth, and once you undo a few layers, there's nothing left.
What you see is what you get. It's almost as she was the supporting actor for
those around her.

Wallace (the politician) was truly a kind man, gentle father, loyal husband and hardworking politician.
Until the very end there is an aurora mystery to how much he knows, which was very well done.
It's unclear if he's a double (triple? quadruple?) agent above everyone else,
is simply ignorant and oblivious, or make the conscious choice to look the other
way. The depth comes from the fact that I'm not sure if the character had any depth.
