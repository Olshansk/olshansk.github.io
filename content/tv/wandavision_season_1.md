Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I watched this series about a year ago but my original review was lost. Overall: MUST WATCH!

Though I love the Marvel Universe, I've stopped watching most of the films and series because it's gotten repetitive. Wanda Vision somewhat managed to stand out and introduce a level of creativity and originality that I have not seen in a long time.

In fact, my mom, who hasn't watched any of the Marvel movies/series very much enjoyed it as well. Though she was lost at certain parts, I believe the first half of the season is a must watch for everyone.
