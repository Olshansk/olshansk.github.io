Instantly in one of my top 5 shows of all time, and it'll likely stay there for a long time.

I don't often re-watch television shows, but I can see myself re-watching this one.
In fact, while making my way through it with my mom for the first time, my dad
joined us for his **THIRD** time seeing it.

The plot is enticing and the actors are fantastic but the hat goes off to [Guy Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Ritchie).
He's an absolute mastermind & visionary who conceives an idea, brings it to live
and creates something that most can't even conceive in the first place.

Before this show, I knew the name but wouldn't have been able to point to anything
specific he had done. After watching it, I'm never forgetting the name and am
planning to go on a "Guy Ritchie" marathon later this year.

The fast-paced cinematography and engaging story-line literally keeps you on
the edge of your seat. I, literally, found myself getting or sitting up thinking
_"no way, no way, no way, no way"_ more times than I can count. Every episode
had at least on moment like this.

The story telling when you build context is nothing I can compare it to. There
were a few moments when I was so mesmorized by how the shots were changing within
a single "scene" that I realized I stopped paying attention to the actual words
and had to rollback.

These amazing scenes are complemented by some very real scenes as well where the
sun is out, the angle is "simple", and the environment just feels real. Before you
know it though, the show takes a twist in a direction you'd never imagine.

It was 8 episodes (8 hours) of full out intensity. Every second of every episode
mattered, was cared for, was thought through and executed to perfection.

I'll be talking about this show all year long, at the very least, and really hope
there's a season 2 in the works.
