Very elegant. An exciting, interesting and fun 10 episode special that anyone who enjoys television should watch at some point.

I don't know how true to reality this show was, but I thought it was beautifully done. It was extremely well balanced between Einstein's young adolescent life, his growth to fame, his family, his love life, his scientific achievements and his political involvement. Every episode and scene seemed to have a mean and it was awesome to follow along.

A few astounding facts I learnt from this show:
1. Einstein really seems like an asshole. I never knew how much he disrespected his wife and how little he was involved with his family. Even from the show, it just doesn't seem to make sense why he acted the way he did.
2. I never knew how crucial his wife was to in helping him solve some of the core problems.
3. I never knew what a pimp Einstein was.
4. I'm very impressed by how politically involved he was in "world peace" towards his later years, and never knew he was such a zionist.
