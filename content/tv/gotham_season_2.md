Episodes 1 - 2
---------------------

I came back to watch the first season for the reason I liked the first: It's a cool story, that's somewhat cheesy but has a much larger element of depth and seriousness behind it than some other superhero shows. That being said, I've seen some good shows since this season last ended (The leftovers, the walking dead, better call saul, house of cards and narcos just to name a few, thought there are many more), and realized that this show doesn't compare. The acting, character development and writing are all subpar. I will keep watching it in the meantime but am not going to commit to finishing the season.
