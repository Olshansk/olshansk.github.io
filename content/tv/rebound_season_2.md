Episode 1
-------------
It is difficult to judge the quality of the film and story as I'm just really pleased to see this show again after almost a year and half of finishing season 1. More of the same dark drawing tone and mysterious characters. The actual shots filmed seem to be of higher quality, so the budget may have very well increased.

Episode 2
-------------
There is a very unsettling feeling watching parts of this show, which is precisely why I love it. That being said, I would really like to know what the hell is going on. The show keeps raising more questions, and the promises of answers keep lining up. I'm beginning to fear that all the mysteries will make their way to the abyss and answers will never be provided but I have hope!

Episode 3
-------------
While I can't say I did not enjoy this episode, it definitely wasn't one of their better ones. The show is moving way too slowly. I get it, the kid just likes staring at everyone. The mother doesn't like her child. The child is important. No one knows what's happening. Let's move on. A slow build up is important and interesting, but only if there is a payoff, and I want to be alive (no pun intended) for when that happens. 

I'm curious to know what they'll find in the deep excavation. Answers perhaps?

I'm also not a fan of Milan. It kind of feels like there will be a lot of conflict surrounding him, which just seems like a distraction from the main plot. Everyone has unresolved problems, and he seems to be the centre of them, but the whole city could not have returned just to deal with him.

Episode 4
-------------
Things are just getting creepier and creepier, and I'm not sure whether the show is approaching a resolution or delving deeper into what seems a well of infinite depth.

The dead have some sort of mind-reading powers. It was confirmed that they are immortal and resurrect if they die again. They're are mysterious people caught on camera in the well, and the half live half dead baby's significance is still unclear.

Episode 5: More of the same thing.

Episode 6
-------------
Do the returned have powers to make you do/think something that's not real or what you don't want to? Why are those being held captive begin see visible skin damage? The kid is beginning to seem like the devil, what's his story? Audrey and her mom finally got back together. It's also great to see Camille's family back together. However, I'm beginning to get anxious of the lack of explanations!

Episode 7: The first half is a little slow and not moves really slowly. The second half is pretty ridiculous though. We're finally beginning to learn more and more of everyone's powers and their past, but the connections are still very lose. I can't wait to learn more about the Victor's history!
