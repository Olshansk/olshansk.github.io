More of the same as in Season 1, and I'm not looking for much more.

It's still an easy, light-hearted, turn-off-the-brain show that appeals to people
myself: aspiring entrepreneurs, techies, while making stupid jokes.

Nothing about this show is award winning or out of the ordinary, but it's a fun
and a relaxing way to end the day.

I'm increasingly loving the cast and they're actually the main reason I'm going
to keep watching.
