Unlike THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH SEEMS TO LOVE THIS SHOW, I HAD MIXED FEELINGS. THE DIFFERENT TIMELINES SEEM TO CONVOLUTE THINGS FOR NO REASON. SETTING "ROBOT RULES" WHICH WERE BROKEN SHORTLY AFTER CREATED CONFUSION. TRYING TO BE SUPER METAPHORICAL AND DEEP AND TAKING ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY WAS ALSO SOMEWHAT LAUGHABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, SEEING TWO ROBOTS WHO HAVE NEVER SHOT A GUN TAKE OUT A WHOLE SWAT TEAM WAS SIMPLY CRINGY. THIS SHOW WAS FILLED WITH SUCH MOMENTS.

THE SHOW IS ORIGINAL, BEAUTIFUL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING IN THEORY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SO MANY LOOPHOLES AND PROBLEMS THAT I'M SUPRISED THE GENERAL POPULATION HAS ACCEPTED THEM SO WELL.
