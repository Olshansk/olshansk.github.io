Episode 1
------------
Great episode in the style of classic House of Cards. I like to see weakness in our two main characters, and Claire's move back with her mother shows that she really needs some support. Frank can't be bothered by Claire on his quest for power. I'm also extremely glad to see Lucas back! I really do believe that he may play a key role in Frank's potential downfall.

The rest of the season
-----------------------------
I don't have too much too much say other than the fact that the whole season was amazing.

A rollercoaster of emotions and events, from Frank's & Claire's fight, to the battle with Conway, the death of Claire's wife, the president being shot, and many different affairs affiliated with many different emotions. The cinematography was great, the storyline was thrilling, and I could never predict what was going to happen next. After a poor third season, the writers came out with what is potentially the best season of HoC so far.
