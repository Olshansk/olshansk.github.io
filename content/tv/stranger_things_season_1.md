Episode 1: I've been hearing a lot about this show and finally decided to give it a shot. Supernatural powers set in a small US town in the 80s? Count me in! I was very intrigued since the very first scene, and lam a fan of all the child actors selected. There wasn't that much depth to the first episode but I can't wait to watch the next one!

Episode 2: One could say that things are getting even stranger! So far, the characters seem very "basic", and there's nothing particularly interesting happening from a computer graphics or cinematography point of view, but the storyline is really pulling me in.

Episodes 3 - 5: Not much to add. A strong cast with an interesting plot done well provides for loads for excitment and entertainment.

Final thoughts: Amazing! It was thrilling, fun, innocent and very sci-fy. The whole cast did an amazing job and the ending was well crafted. There are some mysteries left for a potential season 2, the ending was happy but not overly unrealistic, and the feels were on point.
