The public ratings weren't great, so I was hesitant, but it was a 5/5 in my books.
The first episode wasn't the best, but it REALLY picks up.

Robert De Niro is a master at his craft, and watching him is a privilege.

There are only so many shows or movies we'll get to see him make, so I appreciate each one.

It's cool to see the overlap of his character and his real persona:
an aging well-respected individual back for one last fling.

This could have been a 3 hour movie, but making it a limited series was the right call.
It wasn't too long, not too short, but just right.

Honestly, if you're a fan of De Niro, at least a little bit, you should definitely watch this.

Overall, the show really challenges you what's real and what's not, but ultimately it doesn't matter. The shows is about what's right and wrong, not what's real or not. It's a reminder
to maintain integrity at all costs. It was a mind-bending experience that left me reflecting on my own values and priorities.
