I watched the whole seasons but am still unsure if I'll stick around for the second one.

The show has potential. While the plot is a typical, post-apocalyptic, dystopian, sci-fi, the acting and chemistry between the characters is lacking. Both the show and characters are too serious, and a pinch of comedic relief would go a long way.

Even in a world where everyone lives in a silo with no knowledge of what happened or why, there should still be opportunities to laugh and love and not assume that everyone is depressed all the time.

Everything was mediocre, and it passed the time before going to bed, but nothing stood out.
