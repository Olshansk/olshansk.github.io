Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

A great show with such a throbbing plot that it's hard to believe it's based on a true story. My family watched this together and we constantly wanted it to end but also felt that we can't not finish it.

I both loved and hated Paul Rudd for doing such an amazing job at portraying a character who pretends to care but is abusive and a psychopath in every single way.

I will definitely never watch this again and am not sure if I feel comfortable recommending it to anyone, but it was indeed a good piece of work.
