I thought the ending of Season 2 was crazy, but the team literally went all out
with season 3. Even though it's nearly impossible to match the emotion and attachment
of the scene where Gordo and Tracy reunite ran across the moon's surface, the number
of "bams" here was even bigger.

Just to name a few:

- North Korean individual was the first person on Mars
- North Korea sent people on a suicide mission
- The first US female president comes out as openly gay
- The Nasa office is bombed
- CEO of helious gets overturned
- Karen becomes CEO of helious and dies i the bombing attack
- Ed properls his pregantn daughter of the top of an MSAM into orbit to enter a space craft
- Ed went on a suicide mission and basically survived
- Son of Gordo & Tracy was exiled to a different part of Mars to just live on his own
- Margo Maddison was being investigated and ends up in Russia
- Margo's russian boyfriend ends up in the US
