I can't believe I finished the whole first season, but it was indeed something that was mildly entertaining and passed the time. I had the keyboard by my side, constantly skipping over various parts, so I probably watched it at around 2x speed overall.

The fact that we, humans, like to watch other humans go through this makes me question how evolved or primal our instincts are.
