I read the books when I was a kid and was very excited when I learnt that Apple is going to produce the foundation series. The funniest bit is that I remembered absolutely nothing about the story even though my recollection was that I liked it.

Overall, the actors were good, the graphics were good, the plot was good, but nothing felt "great". I would recommend it to any avid sci-fi fan, or a fan of the series, but I wasn't blown away by it.

The one thing that stood out is the amazing Cleon performance by Lee Pace. Halt and catch fire is one of my all-time favorite shows, and this was another great performance by an actor I adore. He's powerful, charismatic, mulrifascated, charming and so much more.
