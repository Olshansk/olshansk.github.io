Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

I didn't expect it, but this film exceeded all of my expectations.

I wanted a feel-weird kinda-rom-co-ish film, and was okay with something a little trashy.

This wasn't trashy, this was brilliant, deep, thoughtful and touching all at once.

Every single member of the cast did a phenomenal job owning their roles. I'd expect
this level of talent, dynamics and chemistry only a few seasons in, but they hit it
straight off the bat.

I've seen Milly Alcock in the past, but am not becoming a true fan.
