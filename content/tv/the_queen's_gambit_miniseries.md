Absolutely amazing!

I didn't know what to expect of a show where people just sit around playing chess but watched it because it was recommended by several different people. It exceeded all of my expectations.

Anya Taylor‑Joy killed it. Everything from the way she spoke, the way she looked, the way she moved her hand and head in different circumstances couldn't have been more fitting to the character of Beth. Her chemistry with her other characters (the janitor, real and foster parents, love interests, etc...) was perfect and showed a lot of layers and depth to a character that didn't really speak much.

More importantly, there's something really attractive to me about watching a show where an individual is extremely devoted to one task and just wants to be the best at it. The dedication and persistance is motivating and something I want to keep watching.
