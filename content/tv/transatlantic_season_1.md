The show started with me breaking my brain as to where I know the lead female actress
from. Took me a couple of episodes to realize that I used to watch Gillian Jacobs
regularly in Community, during my college years, over a decade ago! She looks the same :)

I watched this show with my mom because I only had 2 weeks at home and we wanted
a mini-series we'll be able to finish and both enjoy. I had no expectations going
into it but absolutely loved it!

This show is the epitome of a dramatized reality / docuseries. It covers a tough
but important topic, keeps a fast pace, has an old vibe to it, but is also filled
with a lot of fun moments.

There's no so much character development, but the balance of the different characters
and how they fill different roles is done very well. In particular, I loved the moments
when famous authors like Marc Chagall make an appearance and fill that "artist void".

The whole series is very enticing, but ultimately, it's a buildup to the last episode.

The last episode is a combination of love and hate, sadness and victory, trauma and
healing, truth and lies. It's life. It's reality. It's a masterpiece.
