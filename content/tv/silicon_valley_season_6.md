This show is amazing and cathartic in every single way. The writers and producers did an amazing job, and I'm sad to know that the chemistry of the main cast has come to an end.

The first 6 episodes of the season were absolutely hilarious whereby I literally laughed out loud on my own at home. The last episode was extremely unexpected, and not the ending I had hoped for, but it was definitely a great way to round things off.
