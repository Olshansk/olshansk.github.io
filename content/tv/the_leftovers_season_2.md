Episode 4: An amazing soundtrack, a lot of movement in the plot, and a great distinction between the toll that this takes on people over the short and long term.

Episode 7: We're finally beginning to get some answers. Old characters are coming, and minor characters are becoming more important. Crazy shit hapens.

Episode 8: Okay.. HOLY FUCK! One of the best episodes of TV I've ever seen. Justin did an AMAZING job. Guilt, confusion, pain and determination all in one character. So different and so unique from everything else I've seen, but I believe that this episode really grasps the theme of the show. It's about the fight, reflection, asking the right questions, feeling helpless, but still driving forward. This episode was a reflection of life. An absolutely amazing episode overall!

Episode 9: Another great episode where things feel like they're finally coming together.

Episode 10: Speechless.
