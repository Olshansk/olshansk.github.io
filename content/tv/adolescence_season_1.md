Phenomenal.

It exceeded all my expectations.

I've been thinking about it every day since I finished watching it a week ago.

I also recommend [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeL_jc1T_KI) with

if, after finishing the series, you feel like you “need more discussion.”

## Unanswered Questions and More to Be Desired?

One of the most intriguing aspects of the show is how many questions it leaves unanswered, inviting the viewer’s interpretation:

- What is Jamie’s **psychoanalysis**? Is he **bipolar**? Was he succumbing to peer pressure? Was he influenced by social media?
- What was his motivation, and is there a risk it could happen again?
- Why did Katie’s friend lash out at the other boy in school?
- Is there more to the story of the knife? Where did it come from, and whose idea was it to get one?

I’m not sure how much of this ambiguity was intentional, due to limited funding, or simply an oversight, but it works nonetheless.

DI Bascombe’s relationship with his son could support an entire spin-off:

- Why are they distant?
- How did their relationship change after this case?

The psychoanalysis of Jamie leaves more to be desired:

- What was the first meeting like?
- What did her notes conclude?
- How does it relate to her other cases?

There’s so much more to explore, but I love the space it leaves for creativity.

## Growing Up Without Social Media

As a **32-year-old**, I keep thinking about how grateful I am that I grew up without social media.

I remember going to the mall, sending “sup” messages to all my friends on MSN Messenger, and discovering random online communities on fringe websites. The days felt longer, and signing up for Facebook in 10th grade was exciting.

Today, managing media consumption is a daily challenge. Doing so when you’re young, insecure, susceptible to peer pressure, and still developing must be terrifying.

In the same way smoking **cigarettes** has become uncommon among Millennials and younger generations, I expect the same decline for social media in those coming up next.

_Side note: I also realized how detached I am from certain parts of culture. I had no clue what an “incel” was and would have overlooked the meaning of some emojis used._

## Fiction or Not?

The show flirts with **suspension of disbelief** while tiptoeing the line of plausibility.

It’s hard to believe a young boy from a good family could commit such an act, yet enough external influence could push anyone that far.

Would his friend really try to flee the school while being chased by the police? It sounds silly, but it’s just within the bounds of something a 13-year-old might do.

The fact that the UK is showing this in schools and beginning to use it as educational material on mental-health issues comes with trade-offs.

## Episode 3

Each episode being shot in a single take is masterful.

Episode 3 stood out in particular: almost an entire hour spent in one room watching a therapy-style session that never feels dull.

I won’t add much more, but the performances of both actors (Jamie and Briony) **deserve** an award.

## Episode 4

Likewise, we forget the final episode is also shot in one take, though the environment shifts much more.

Eddie Miller’s internal battle—wanting to be a good father, grappling with the aftermath, and confronting the truth—can only be felt, not described.

I didn’t love the episode at first, but I got into it after about 30 minutes.

It also made me realize I’m getting older, as I resonated with the father’s emotions far more than I expected.
