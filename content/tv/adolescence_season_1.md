Phenomenal.

Exceeded all my expectations.

Been thinking about it every day since I finished watching it,
a week as of writing this review.

I also recommend [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeL_jc1T_KI) with
William Costello on the [Modern Wisdom Podcast](https://chriswillx.com/podcast/),
if you feel like you just "need more discussion" after finishing the series.

## Unanswered Questions and more to be desired?

One of the interesting things about the show is that it left a lot of questions unanswered
and up for interpretation by the viewer:

- What is Jamie's pscho-analysis? Is he bi-polar? Is it peer pressure? Was he influenced by social media?
- What was the motivation? Is there a risk it can happen again?
- Why did Katie's friend lash out at the other boy in school?
- Is there more to the story of the knife? Where did it come from? Whose idea was it to get a knife?

I don't know how much of this was intentional and by design, a result of lack of funding,
or an oversight, but it worked nonetheless.

Bascombe's (the DI) relationship with his son could be a spinoff.

- Why are they distant?
- How did their relationship change after this case?

- What was the first meeting like?
- What did her notes conclude?
- How does it relate to her other cases?

So much more to be desired but I love the room it leaves for creativity.

## Growing Up Without Social Media

As a 32 year old, a thought that kept popping into my mind is how grateful I am for
growing up without social media.

I remember the days of going to the mall, sending "sup" messages to all my friends
on MSN messenger and discovering random online communities on a variety of fringe websites.

The days felt longer and signing up for FaceBook.com in 10th grade was cool.

Today, it's a daily challenge to manage media consumption. Doing so while you're
young, insecure, susceptible to peer pressure, have a developing mind and in the
earlier stages of understanding yourself must be terrifying.

In the same way that smoking cigarets isn't common by Millennials onwards, I expect
the same to happen to social media by the upcoming generations.

_Side note: I also realized how detached I am from certain parts of culture. I had no clue what an incel, and would have overlooked the meaning of the emojis used._

## Fiction Or Not?

The show flirted with a suspense of disbelief while tip toeing the line of believability.

It's hard to believe a young boy from a good family could commit such an action.
At the same time, enough external influence could push a person to do such a thing.

Would his friend really try to flee the school while running away from the police?
It's silly, but verges the lines of something a 13 year old would do.

The fact that the UK is showing this in schools and beginning to treat it as
a source of education w.r.t to mental health issues comes with tradeoffs.

## Episode 3

The fact that every episode was shot in one take is masterful.

The third episode stood out to me in particular, because it's almost an entire
hour spent in one room, watching a sort of therapy session, and it wasn't dull for a moment.

I won't add much to it, but the performance of both actors (playing Jamie and Briony) deserves an award.

## Episode 4

In a similar fashion, we forget the last episode was shot in one take as well, but
the environment varied so much more.

Eddie Miller's self battle of wanting to be a good father, grapling with the aftermath, but also the truth
can only be felt, not described.

I didn't love the last episode, but got into it after about 30 minutes.

It also made me realize how old I'm getting as I was able to resonate with the father's
emotions much more than I expected.

You know you‚Äôre getting bold and you can relate more to the parents and the kids, even if someone doesn‚Äôt have kids.
