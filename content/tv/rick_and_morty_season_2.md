Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Episodes 1 - 4: Getting more funny and better with every single episode.

Episode 5: There's something about the musical episodes that also gets to me. Community and Kim Possible are the first two that come to mind, but I love the spin Rick and Morty took on it. How do they come up with this shit?

Episode 6 - 10: Hilarious. I think Rick and Morty has officialy become one of my favorite shows at this point. Can't wait for season 3!
