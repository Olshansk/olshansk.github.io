Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

A great way to disconnect and unwind at the end of the day. An uncensored version of "The office" meets Big Mouth with a ton of sex and hilarious jokes. This show isn't for everyone, and I can't say "I love it", but I find it extremely entertaining and plan to keep watching it. For lack of a better world, it helps me get my _fix_.
