The takes for this game were high but squid game did not disappoint. Loved it,
and can't wait for the second season to be released already.

I think its fair to say the first season of Squid Game was an instant cult classic.
I didn't know what to expect of the second one, but I can imagine the level of pressure
the team behind it had to live up to the expectations. They did so, and beyond.

The first season was a novel concept, suspenseful, original and very captivating.
They touched on the deep flaws in human behaviour, but it felt a bit superficial
and unexplored.

The second season went deep. There's real character development, the layers of our
flaws are being peeled, and it's turning from pure entertainment to reflection.

The fact that there are a few micro storylines in parallel is critical, and I honestly
just can't wait for the next one.

**Spoilers below**

Some of my favorite moments and themes:

1. Seong's transformation from the first to the second season is real. The moment where he went back to his "old ways" with his friend felt very humbling and a reminder of how our experiences shape our lives.
2. Hwang's suicide during the russian roulette game was a masterpiece of a scene. Nothing to add.
3. Thanos's character was very fun, refreshing and necessary.
4. As someone who was in crypto, the "coin" sub-plot is VERY accurate and doesn't feel fake. It's how we all really feel in the industry.
5. The ship captain being a man on the inside is mind-blowing.
6. The fact that the organizer of everything was one of my favorite plot twists.
