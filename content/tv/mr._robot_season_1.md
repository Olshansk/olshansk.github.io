Though it takes a little time to take off, this show does know less than blow your mind as the first season culminates. A depressed, hacker, nerd type protagonist, with a few characteristics slightly in excess, manages to scare me, annoy me, and excite me. A twisted plot, an eery mood, with a very captivating premise done just right.
