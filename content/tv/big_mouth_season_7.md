I don't have much to add that I didn't say in my review of Season 6: it's more of the same thing, and it's why love it.

The directors are doubling down on the formula that made the show a success, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Andrew is gross, Jessi is a stoner, Nick is a nerd, Missy is increasingly anxious, and the fourth wall is torn apart.

The brilliance of the show is doubling down on what the case loves, but being original through the introduction of new characters and new situations. More monsters, more characters, more situations, most importantly, HIGH SCHOOL!
