Rating: ⭐⭐🌟

Took me four months to get through this one between holidays, travel and finishing
multiple other shows in between.

Is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. It's just a fun watch that's a bit
weird, with a few good moments, and a couple of good actors that carry the entire
team.

A few of the character arcs are very real and unique portrayals of real personalities.

For example, the lead detective wishes the best for others, but doesn't act on it.
The nuns act in faith, but actually serve tea that makes everyone trip. At the end
of the day, it shows that everyone does (and should?) act in their own best interest,
but it doesn't mean that they don't care about the people around them, because they do.

I don't see myself recommending this to anyone, and I also wouldn't commit to season
2 if it were to ever come out.
