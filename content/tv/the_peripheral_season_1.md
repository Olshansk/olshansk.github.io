I'm biased because I'd give 5 stars to any show or movie Chloe Grace Moretz is part of, but this one is genuinely one of her biggest comebacks.

The show is futuristic, but also realistic. It requires a little suspense of disbelief, but it does feel like it's right around the corner. It's a bit scary at time, but also manages to be fun. It's scripted, but obviously gave the actors a lot of room to explore who their characters are and why.

Most importantly, Chloe's performance as a girl, as a gamer, as a woman, as a robot, as a lover, as a peripheral and as a daughter is abso-fucking-lutely amazing.
