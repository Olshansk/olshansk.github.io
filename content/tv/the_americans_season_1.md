Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Episode 1: Holy shit, I think I'm hooked! I love that the show picks up 20 years into their marriage where things are seeming to finally show some cracks. I'm excited to learn about their backstory, about what they do and just how American they really are. The characters felt very real and I can't wait to keep watching this show.
