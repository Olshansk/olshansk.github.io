The last season was very much made for the fans.

If you hadn't fallen in love with the the story, the characters, and the overall vibe
of the show, this season is not for you.

It felt like they forced some ideas to close the loop on things from earlier in
the show. Ben's death is a concrete example of this. The plot just felt overdone.

But, even thought the plot was overdone, the cast killed it. Their chemistry was
amazing, the characters were dynamic, and the love triangle between Lila, Five
and Diego was an absolute bliss.

I'd say the actors for Viktor and Reginald were weak, but Lila and Five were powerful.
Luther, Diego and Klaus were funny and nice. Allison was a bit boring. Overall though,
there was enough support and chemistry across the board that it was a team effort
with no one carrying or bringing the show down.

If you are reading this and curious about watching the show from the start, I'd
say it's worth it. If you're into "quirky but gory" like "Knives Out" or "Shawn of
the Dead", this is the show for you.

I love the plot, the characters, and the amazing balance of gruesome, silly entertaining and funny. This show just keeps getting better and better with every season, and I can't wait for season 4!

I found some [fan fiction on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UmbrellaAcademy/comments/1enoays/spoilers_this_is_how_the_umbrella_academy_finale) and loved this alternate ending:

> Towards the end, each of the siblings takes the subway as transportation and by chance they all end up in the same subway car. They are all strangers though. They don't interact with each other at all during the ride, but there is this vibe as each sibling is taking a glance at each other with that "I feel like I know you." look. The subway suddenly stops, due to some techincal difficulties, and the siblings make some quick small talk amongst each other about the subway car stopping. For a while there is silence except for the subway intercom playing some random elevator music. And then, the intercome starts playing "I think we're alone now", the same rendition from the last episode. Each sibling is casually vibing to the song in their own way. It's not like a flat out dance scene or dramatic chorus. It's something simple where each sibling is doing their own thing of listening to the song to help pass the time of the subway getting fixed. There's this moment of familiarity and harmony during this scene for these "strangers" but we as the fans know them as the siblings we have seen since season 1 and there's the bittersweet message that they have unknowingly reunited one last time.

> The subway is fixed and continues it's route. It reaches its destination and all of the siblings move on with their normal lives, and that's where the season ends.
