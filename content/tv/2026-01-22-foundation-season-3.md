Every season of _Foundation_ keeps getting better.

The characters are merging with the actors. The plot is becoming more intricate. The stakes keep rising.

This season took turns I never expected. More importantly, it shows that everyone has weaknesses. Power, wealth, intelligence, abilities, love, even different forms of existence are never perfect. No one is ever fully content, no matter what or how much they have.

Whether you're human, a robot, or even a god, existence and meaning are questioned by everyone.

Wrap all of that in a science fiction epic by Isaac Asimov, with Apple’s creative freedom and budget, and you get _Foundation_ at its best.

I can’t wait for season 4.
