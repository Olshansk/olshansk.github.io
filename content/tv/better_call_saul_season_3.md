Episode 1: Even though I love the fact that the show picked up exactly where it left of, I would've liked a bit of a recap. Thought nothing grand happened, there is a lot of tension between Chuck and Jimmy that will definitely go south, and Mike's investigation is thrilling. When you come to think of it, Mike has almost no dialogue yet it's amazing how much informatino and emotion he conveys through his actions.

Episodes 4 - 5: The frequent use of silence, long uncut shots, office sounds and wide shots is amazing. Aside from the strong cast and amazing storyline, the show has an essence that carries it from one scene to the next.
