Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

A fresh and original feel-good and thoughtful TV show full of amazing actors, peculiar characters, and a plot you get attached to. I absolutely loved every single episode, every character in their own way, and every plot twist.

The show felt humane, warm and honest. Most importantly, I felt that the show gave the actors an opportunity to really test and practice their acting abilities, which is meta given the subject manner of the show.
