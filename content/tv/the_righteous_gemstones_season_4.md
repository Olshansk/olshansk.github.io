Phenomenal final season to a show I enjoyed but didn't love until the very end.

Since I couldn't relate to the characters directly, it took me a little bit of time to get "attached".

After four seasons, I could see the character development the directors were going for.

It was less about changing oneself, but more about learning to love, accept and accommodate those around you as they are.

It's a key example of achieving one's dreams by making the dreams of those around you a reality.

It took the weirdest twists and turns, and a very refreshing deviation from the norm.

My favorite moment was when the three of them were lying on the floor, bleeding out, on their potential deathbeds, yet they were still able to quarrel about silly terminology. True sibling love.

Some endings are bittersweet, but this one was just sweet. The only thing I would have loved is a slight expansion of the golden bible. Feels like there a stone left unturned.
