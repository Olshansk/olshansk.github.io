Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

It's been a few years since I watched a full season of south park from start to finish and must say that I'm extremely impressed! I love the fact that it was one continuous story, with brilliant writing, exploring a few avenues of political discourse that somehow came together at the end. Most importantly, it was fucking hilarious, 'member?
