Off to a slow start, but it gets better with every episode. You can sense how the actors became more comfortable with each other over time, and it really came across on screen. It's either amazing acting, or just organic chemistry, but more likely both.

Absolutely love each character and it's a great reminder that everyone deals with a tone of problems. Young, old, single, married, therapist or not: we all need each other's support all the time.
