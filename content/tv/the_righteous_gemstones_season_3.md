I can’t tell if the show is growing on me or if it’s getting better.

It feels like as the actors get more comfortable with their roles, and the storylines mature, it’s not just fun and games. It’s becoming real and challenging.

It’s the sort of show only HBO can pull off, and it has transitioned from something I watch passively when there’s nothing else to something I genuinely enjoy and look forward to.
