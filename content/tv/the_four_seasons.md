This was a fun pallet cleanser after watching [Zero Day](/tv/zero_day.md).

I enjoyed, but I didn't love it not hate it. I can't say it was good, but it was better than mediocre.

The story and concept were great. The execution was descent. The leading group of actors
were were 50/50, and I feel like the poor performers really dragged everyone down.

Steve Carell is awesome, and he did an amazing job at carrying the team, but he is a
single individual who can only do so much. Honestly, killing him off killed the show...
