Another season of Loot that delivered exactly what I wanted: a palate cleanser between heavier shows I’m watching in parallel like Severance and Foundation.

As with previous seasons, this isn’t a show I actively recommend to people. It is a show I enjoy watching, and one I’ll keep returning to as new seasons come out.

It’s simple, funny, and satirical without taking itself seriously. Every so often, it sneaks in a surprisingly grounded life lesson. The core premise remains fairly original, so even though the show itself can feel a bit globe-nomadic and episodic, it still feels fresh enough to justify its place in the rotation.

It was also interesting to see how little Adam Scott appeared this season. Given how much of a run he’s been on lately, I wouldn’t be surprised if it came down to availability or cost rather than creative choice.

In short: not prestige TV, not trying to be. Solid, lightweight entertainment that knows exactly what it is.
