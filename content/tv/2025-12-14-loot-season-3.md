Another season of Loot that delivered what I wanted - a "pallete cleanser" between some of the deeper shows I'm watching in parallel like Severance and Foundation.

As with previous seasons, this isn't a show I can recommend, but it is a show I enjoy watching, and will keep watching as new seasons come out.

It's a simple, funny, satertical show that doesn't take itself seriously, and is interspersed with some deeper life lessons. The overarching idea is pretty original, so even though the show itself is an "globe nomane", it's refreshing.

It's intersting to see how Adam Scott only had an appearance or two across the whole season. He's been on a tear recently, and I wouldn't be surprised if he was either too expensive or too busy for Loot.
