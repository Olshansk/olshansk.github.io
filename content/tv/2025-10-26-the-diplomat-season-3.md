Having finished the first two seasons about a month ago, I didn't have to wait long for Season 3. That said, I don't know how I'm supposed to survive a year (or more) for Season 4.

The main cast is changing form, a little bit, but also maturing. As actors, as individuals, as characters, and most importantly, the way their characters play off each other.

Things are getting heated, and just when you think you know what's going on, a twist hits you. Even though we're watching the show from a third person's perspective, it's amazing how we're passively in the passenger seat of Kate Wyler's information knowledge base.

Other than the fact that the show is amazing, I believe one of the reasons I continue to love the show is because I see a lot of myself in Kate. She's ambitious, hard working, what's to make a change, but doesn't quite align with the system. It's not that she wants to change it, but it drains her to be a part of it. She knows what to do, but it's easier said than done. At times, she realizes she's the problem, but she's not sure how to fix it.

Kate - I get it.

Also, Keri Russel is a legend, and hot as fuck.
