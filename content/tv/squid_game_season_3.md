A phenomenal ending to an already phenomenal series.

A text review can't do it justice because you have to see and feel the emotions of the characters.

The evolution of every character, and the paths they chose, are a true mirror of reality.

This, IMHO, is the real black mirror of society.

It's a cult classic, and every moment of every scene was embodied by both power and emotion.

I'll end it here. This is a must watch.
