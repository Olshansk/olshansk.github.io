A TV show that fits the bill when you want something light-hearted, but funny.
Something that can get gory but also doesn't take itself too seriously. Something
that's a little crazy but not too much. Something that has character development
but isn't satire comedy.

This show fits the bill.

Succession meets The Office with a bit of South Park and a Christian twist.
If you're interested in the above, this is a show for you.
