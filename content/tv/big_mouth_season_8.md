Big Mouth continues, with every episode of every season, to deliver top-notch quality.

It’s more of the same, but when the show can’t get any better, that’s a VERY tall order.

Somehow, the same characters didn’t get old. The show didn’t get cringy.

Redrawing Nick while keeping everyone else the same was a brilliant idea and really threw a curveball into the show.

They could’ve kept going, but they ended on a high note, and I’m sure all fans will be grateful that it wasn’t overdone. It’s clear they’re setting themselves up for an “adults version” of Big Mouth, and I really hope it won’t be an “adults version of Rugrats.”
