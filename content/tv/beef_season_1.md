Surprising in all the right and wrong ways. It's cathartic, cringy, surprising,
enticing, real, powerful, sad, thoughtful, retrospective and simply raw.

This show is the start to a great anthology. It depicts real life, showing how
quickly things can escalate if we don't keep things in check.

It started off strong, but just seemed like a couple people hitting rough parts
of life in different ways. The first 60% of the show wasn't slow, but felt normal.
Things escalated very quickly, very realistically, to the point of disbelief. Only
then did it show the importance of having someone who truly understands you.

Lastly, as Chekhov said, "If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall,
then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there." It
continues to hold true.
