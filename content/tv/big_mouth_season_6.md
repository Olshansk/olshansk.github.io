It's more of the same thing, and I love it.

It's hilarious, disgusting, nostalgic and original: horny adults in kids' bodies with hormone monsters driving everything they do.

The writers make it light, funny, entertaining, and occasionally break the fourth wall and just disgusting enough without making the viewer uncomfortable. There is a deeper lesson in every episode, but it is delivered in a very light and fun way, so you don't feel drained after watching the show.

I'm just going to keep on watching and can't wait for the next season!
