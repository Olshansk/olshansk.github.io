I accidently stumbled upon this show Apple TV recommended it, and I absolutely loved it.

We've seen alient invasions, zombies, plagues and everything else. This felt like a venn diagram of "Better Call Saul", "The Leftovers", and "Arrival". Intriguing, dark, unique and enthralling.

It has creative moments, yet also manages to go really deep into human nature.

I personally love how "The Others" have as little understanding into their consciousness and existence as we do into hours. It's a great take on alien civilizations.

It took me a while to remember where I saw Rhea Seehorn, but once I made the "Better Call Saul" connection, it clicked. She's the perfect individual for this role. Also, I've got to call how that she looks phenomenal. I couldn't believe how old she is when I looked it up.

Easy 5 stars. Can't wait for the second season.
