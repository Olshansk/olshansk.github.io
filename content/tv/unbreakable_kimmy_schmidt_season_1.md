Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Amongst the lines of other shows such ass Modern Family or Community, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was a new and refreshing change. Over-the-top stereotypical characters, in a somewhat unrealistic scenario, facing unlikely issues in life, but solving them in a genuinely humble and funny way. 

Not something I would come home running to, but definitely a great show to watch. I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of Season 2, beucase more of the same thing would not be sufficient.
