My friend and I like to recommend each other interesting podcasts, books, tv shows and movies that are not just engaging and fun, but also insightful and thought-provoking.

I recently recommended him BoJack Horseman as a show that goes very deep and triggers a lot of introspection. I later found it ironic that the show I recommended for something like this is a "cartoon about a horse". It made me realize that it's part of the point: a balance between life while also not taking things too seriously.
