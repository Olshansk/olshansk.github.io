The cast found their chemistry and raised in the second season's acidity. Everyone has their own struggles in this world, and the bear caters (pun intended) to everyone.

For those who know the mental struggle Sydney and Carmy are going through with their life goals & priorities, this hits too close to home...

The "romance" between Sydney and Carmy is captivating. The fact that every character had their own "coming of age" arc was refreshing to see, as opposed to having everyone huddled together all the time. The internal struggles everyone is facing are JUST real enough.

Most importantly, the intensity of the show, the story and the characters treads the line of brilliant and "too much" but never exceeds the threshold. I enjoyed season 1, I loved season 2, and I'm looking forward to simply continue seeing this show get better and better.
