Another great season of Stranger Things!

Firstly, I'm very glad that they hired real Russian actors to play the Russian parts (except for the hitman).

Even though the show is targeted at both younger and older audiences, it had a Game of Thrones feel to it. The writers & directors were not afraid to killing of primary characters in an effort to have a "happy ending" where everyone wins. This season invoked legitimate feer through me at times, and had a fine balance of fantasy realism with the quirks of having 10-year-olds infiltrate a Russian military base.

My favorite season is definitely Dustin's and Suzie's NeverEnding story scene. The car with everyone in it is being chased by the Mind Flayer, Dustin is handling all the communication at the top of a hill, Hopper is at the center of a Russian military base, Murray is racing for time, and they start singing a song! The balance of fun, scary, realistic, fantasy and entertaining comic relief is done extremely well!
