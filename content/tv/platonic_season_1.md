Fun, original, real, and honest. It's not an Oscar winner I would ever re-watch, but it's a show I'll remember and recommend to friends.

Rose Byrne is authentic and sexy. Seth Rogen is hilarious and clumsy. The chemistry between them felt so genuine and authentic that I found myself smiling throughout the show. 😄

The montage that the show presents at the end of the last episode captures everything perfectly and made me 🥹. Two friends who can be themselves with each other, being silly, doing drugs, having fun, and creating memories.

The relationship that never was. The hookup that never happened. It's bittersweet, but I believe the show teaches us that the person we need to let off some steam with may not necessarily be the one who should be a lifelong partner. A "best friend" can come in many different shapes and forms, and while our partner is a "best friend" in our everyday life, we can have another "best friend" who plays a different role, under different circumstances, and on different timelines.

Not all good things have to last forever, but joyful memories do.
