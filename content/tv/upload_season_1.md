Unique and intriguing, but nothing mind-blowing.

I was looking for a light comedic show with a sci-fi angle. On the drama/comedy spectrum, this show definitely leans a lot more towards the drama side, but the idea is unique (and very relevant in today's day and age) that I decided to keep watching it.

Hard to recommend, but I definitely enjoyed it and will consider watching the second season.
