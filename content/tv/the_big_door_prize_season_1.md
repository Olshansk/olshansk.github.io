Takes a little bit of time to pick up steam, but is otherwise fun, original and different. I feel that the show is still on training wheels but has a lot of untapped potential.

I was confused if I was watching a coming of age show, a sitcom, a sci-fi, a dark drama, a view of life, or a light-hearted comedy. The show tried to do a little bit of everything, so while I'm unsure the vibe Season 2 will go for, I'll definitely watch it.

The dynamic between the teenagers is by far my favorite, and this is the first time I can really tell that I'm a generation older than current high schoolers...
