Episode 1: While I wasn't really looking for a new show to watch, I decided to check this out because it's produced by Rocket Jump. It was filmed well, the idea is original and it was fairly entertaining. However, in an age where this is so much good tv to choose from and so little time to watch it, this show does pale to impress.

Episode 2: Significantly more impressive than the first episode. I was pleasantly surprised that they're following a Black Mirror type of approach where episode follows a completely different storyline. It's also very similar to Black Mirror in the sense that it follows a futuristic/dystopic world. The second episode started out very funny and friendly but took a very cringy turn and thought I enjoyed it, I felt very uncomfortable towards the end. I definitely need a week off of Dimensions 404, but am legitimately looking forward to the next episode.
