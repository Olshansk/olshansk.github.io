Narcos:

Episode 1: Im hooked.
Episode 2: I thought the story-telling aspect of the show was going to deteriorate after the introduction, but its still staying strong. A very captivating story, with very incisive characters, presented in exciting matter makes you want to keep watching this show.
Episode 3: Arguably the best medium to deliver an interesting history lesson that wont bore you to sleep.

I cannot speak for the historical accuracy of this show, but I thought it was phenomenal overall. The storyline is captivating. The actors are handpicked particularly well and really give off an essence of the character they are portraying. The show is very beautifully shot: the actions scenes are thrilling, the drama scenes make you a little anxious, the mystery scenes make you dwell, and there is a very good balance.

I'm really looking forward to the next season!
