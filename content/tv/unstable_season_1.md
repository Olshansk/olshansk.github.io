As a so called "tech bro" in his 30s and failed (but continually aspiring) entrepreneur I was able to relate with both Ellis and Jackson on deep and superficial levels.

The show had just the right balance of making someone cringe about the realities of the tech world, touching on deep dark topics, and quickly floating back up with comedic relief. The directors did over exaggerate some truths of how we think and approach day-to-day decisions, but I do not think it strayed too far from reality.

The supporting cast seemed inexperienced, but I got a feeling that everyone had fun filming the show and I can't wait for the next season.
