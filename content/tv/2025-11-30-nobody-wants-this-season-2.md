The first few episodes were slow, but it started picking up.

The first season was very "meh" in my opinion, but it passed the threshold of "good enough" to serve as a palate cleanser between more serious shows that I watch in parallel.

There are a lot of hidden lessons related to understanding yourself, your partner, finding compromise, and the fine balance of self-preservation, self-fulfillment, self-improvement, and self-sacrifice.

In between, funny moments like "Temple Ahava" being the most woke synagogue in the world, and Sasha's dancing, serve as great moments of comic relief.

The ending was absolutely heartwarming. Noah doesn't care, while Joanne realizes she's Jewish, so it's the most romantic ending possible.

The only thing that frustrates me as I watch it is how much I feel I care less about being Jewish.

It's about the people, the relationships, the dinners, the care for each other, the sense of community. I care about understanding my ancestry, but being Jewish is just a small part of who I am. It doesn't define me, nor did I do anything to earn it.

I see too many people make it their whole identity.

I support the Jewish population and believe they deserve their own state, but so does everyone else. I love the fact that I have a community everywhere I go, and would love to open an office in Tel Aviv one day. I connect deeper with people who had a similar upbringing, share similar values, perspectives, and goals.

However, you don't have to be Jewish to be part of that community.
