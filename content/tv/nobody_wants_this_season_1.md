I'd classify this under "trash tv" but with a bit of class.

That said, it's a great "turn off the brain" show before bed. I'm not 100% sure
if I'd enjoy it at all if I wasn't Jewish, but I am, so I did.

Stereotypical american jews meet stereotypical blonde girls, and a romantic comedy ensues.
Beneath the surface, there are serious themes of identity, family, religion, love and where the boundaries of each lie.

The show does question practicality of love. Emotion over reason. It does get heartfelt at times.
My biggest issue is that the actors haven't managed to achieve "The Notebook" level type of
chemistry. It felt a bit forced.

Would I ever recommend this to anyone? No.

Am I looking forward to season 2? Yes.
