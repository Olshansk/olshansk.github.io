After finally catching up on all the released seasons/episodes, I have to admit that Big Mouth has gone from a "I guess I"ll check this out" to "Nothing can match Rick & Morty, but this is definitely an interesting parallel".

The show is not afraid to break any walls or cross any boundaries. It has gone from "average kids going through puberty" to "puberty on shrooms" and I love it!
