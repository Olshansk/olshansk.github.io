Episodes 1 - 2: Really glad the show is back and that it picks up exactly where it left of. All the characters seem to have very well defined rolls now so I'm kind of curious to see where their stories and personalities will take them next. Just seeing things play out won't be enough to keep me intrigued.

Episode 3: While there was nothing in particular that blew me away, I think it was an overall solid episode that progressed a lot of different storylines with some minor twists. I would compare it to episode 3 or 4 in a GoT season. Jaha goes on a small exciting mission that nothing came out of. Octavia shows off her skills and finds her "long lost sister". Raven makes a list and a reference to the shows name #BonusPoints. Murphy keeps being a lovable thief and keeps toying with my emotions. Pretty much got everything I came for.

Episode 4: Loving all the characters recently. Octavia is a badass, Monty grew some balls, Jaha is still old and wise, and Clark just keeps on looking good.
