It's hard to rate any season of this show anything less than five stars. This show is thrilling, gory, funny, exciting, pensive, miraculous, and awe inspiring. It is the only show that makes me want the weekend to culminate asap, just so that another episode would be released. When the reason ends, I can't bear the thought of knowing that I have to wait 42 weeks, just for another 10 weeks of GoT entertainment. 

Watching Game of Thrones is like being in a dream I wish I never had to wake up from.

While I was a little disappointed that we did not get to see Bran stark the whole season, and even though the first half of the season was a little slow, the last few episodes of each season are always filled with so many surprised that they more than compensate for any built-up disappointment one could have had.

Daenerys Targaryen is beginning to show a little weakness as she loses the loyalty of her people, her dragons, and begins to question both herself and those around her. Arya Stark is doing her own thing turning into a silent assassin. Royalty proves to have a chink in the armor. Tyrion is still alive and thinking. The night's watch can't keep their shit together. But most importantly, winter is coming!
