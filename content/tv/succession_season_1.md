Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Extremely engaging from the very first scene.

Usually, when character relationships are built on a lot of fictional history,
it takes actors at least a season to get the feel for it. This cast seems to have
aced it straight from the beginning, and it makes the show what it is.

The brotherly closeness. The "game" that everyone keeps playing. The weird balance
of power that everyone simultaneously loves, hates, despises but also can't live
without. It's all done extremely well.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because while the show is awesome,
engaging, original, fun to watch and I'd recommend it to all my friends, it's not
on the same level (yet) as those who truly deserve five stars; Game of Thrones,
Breaking Bad, The Leftovers, etc...
