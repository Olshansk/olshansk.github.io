Fills the bill if you're looking for a dark German limited series, so the acting and vibe aligned with what I expected.

However, there was no character development, and the plot seemed to have just ended. There might have been one or two nice moments at the end, but it wasn't enough to account for all the build-up and suspense where I expected things to really come together. A small surprise would have been nice, but it just felt boring...

Would not recommend to anyone.
