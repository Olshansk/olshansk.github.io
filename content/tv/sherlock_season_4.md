Episode 1: This was more of the classic sherlock we know and love, which is exactly what I was hoping for. It was intriguing, exciting and thrilling. Full of plot twists, cool camera angles, mysteries, and a conflict between our favorite protagonists. The ending was very unanticipated so I'm looking forward to see where it'll go from here.

Episodes 2 - 3: Words cannot express how much I loved this seasons. It was absolutely brilliant.
