A phenomenal, thrilling, and sometimes difficult to watch series. If this were a fictional Hollywood production, I would say that the writing was great. Given the fact that this was based on a true story, it makes every single scene so much more powerful.

Sacha Cohen, playing Eli Cohen, with a mind-blowing performance, carried the show in a way I could have never expected or predicted. All the supporting cast did a great job, but my hat goes off to Borat.

The recreation of both Israel and Syria in the 1960s, and the color contrasts between different scenes made the show beautiful as well. Most of Kamel's rich scenes in Syria had vibrant colours and fun parties, making you forget that it was all an act. The last episode was entirely black & wide, foreshadowing the already obvious outcome that Eli's time has come to an end. Everything about the way the film was shot was amazing.

As a short 6 episode limited series, there is no reason not to watch this!
