With the series finale, I can confidently say The Leftovers is officially one of my favorite shows.

It's only three seasons, but every minute is packed with so much emotion. It is neither shorter or longer than it needs to be, and it never tries to do too much.

Mixing weird scientific incidents with historical biblical references in a modern setting isn't easy, but The Leftovers does it in such a way that there's no room for me to complain. It has a great mix of the impact of The Leftovers on the individual, but also society as a whole. It's well balanced enough that I never felt like I was missing, or had too much, of either one or the other.

All the questions that should've been answered were, and all the other ones that shouldn't have were not. The ending is beautiful, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
