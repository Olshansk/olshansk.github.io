Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

The first few episodes were extremely captivating, but it started getting a little bit repetitive towards the end.

A new superhero hero is always exciting, but I'm afraid that one season is more enough. Similar to Arrow, Flash, Gotham and many others that draw in their viewers into a new world full of new characters, I can easily see this show fall down the same rabbit hole.

The show started off deep, emotional, confusing and challenging to comprehend. However, all these challenges were resolved very simply in a childish fashion leaving me not craving for more.

Entertaining but would not recommend.
