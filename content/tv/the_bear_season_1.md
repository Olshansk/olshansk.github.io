Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I never thought that watching people making sandwiches in a small Chicago cafe could be interesting.

Both the character development and the character dynamics are amazing, so hats off to both the writers and the actors. The cinematography is simple, but some of the scenes really hit home and remind me of Better Call Saul.

Honestly cannot wait for the second season!
