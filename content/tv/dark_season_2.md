HOLY SHIT!!!!!!! This show is mind-blowing.

Dark is making it's way to being one of my favorite shows alongside Fringe, Halt and Catch Fire, The Leftovers, and Game of Thrones. Just when you think that things can't get any weirder, they somehow manage to throw a curveball at you. Every episode is an adventure.

Unlike a lot of TV shows these days, Dark has True Tone and character. It's an understatement to say that the characters change and evolve over time. The interactions between the same individual at different points in their life is amazing. The writers, the actors and the directors jointly do an amazing job on every single front.

I particularly enjoy the musical montage at the end of every episode. It feels a little cliche, but definitely adds a lot given how many different moving pieces there are at any single point in time. I also really like the ominous choice of music at the end of every episode, which is surprising given how much I hate the intro sequence.

I realize there is a lot of messed up shit going on, and that everyone in the show is German, but I do feel that the characters are a little too serious most of the time. You barely every get to see any of them smile amidst all the madness.

It's really interesting to see how so many people manage to accept the fact that they play a very small role in the grand scheme of things. Only Jonas/Adam are truly key to everything, and I honestly still can't make up my mind about Adam. The only thing that bothers me about the interactions between Adam and Jonas is why Adam is being so secretive. It shouldn't have been a surprise to Jonas that there is a "parallel world". Why did middle age Jonas tell him about it? Why didn't Claudia tell him about it? This is the only "loophole" that bothers me.
