If you're into time travel, you should definitely watch it. If it's not your favorite genre, you should still watch it.

I watched both seasons in quick succession within a 2 week period. That should say enough.

An original take on time travel that kept it real without overdoing it.

I loved how certain scenes and shots were reused because it added to the reality of it all.

The take on "groundhog day" was unlike I've seen before, and I could literally feel the character's pain.

Season 2 ended on a cliffhanger because they were expecting a Season 3, but somehow, I'm still not mad.
It was two seasons of amazing, refreshing original content.
