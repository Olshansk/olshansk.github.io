As a time travel junkie, my opinion is definitely biased.

The bits where they try to explain/rationalize time travel, it's very cheesy. Everything else is absolutely amazing. The character backstories, development, relationships, and hardhips are all absolutely amazing.

If you're a fan of anything related to time travel, this is a must watch.
