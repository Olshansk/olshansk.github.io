While the first season was something unlike we've ever seen before, the second season was more of the same thing, which is just what it needed to be.

Though the first season had a lot more memorable moments and touching highlights, like the day you quite your job to pursue your startup, the moment you first get funding, and the infamous dick scene, the second season did not disappoint either.

For anyone who works in the valley, the show is very cathartic, touching on subjects one deals with on a day to day basis with the incorporation of just the right amount of cringing humor.
