Absolutely loved it.

The show is unique, suspenseful, original, intriguing, and just sets a really high bar for quality.
Every season keeps the same bar as the last one.

The last time there was a show that made me look forward to Sunday evening was Game of Thrones and Silicon Valley. White Lotus managed to achieve the same vibe.

Fun fact: one thing I didn't realize up until the very end is that the older brother is Arnold Schwarzenegger's son!!!

Can't wait for the next season, and I'll wait patiently for it.
