It started out very weird, and I wasn't really sure what to expect... Eventually, the way James learned to love Alyssa, I learned to love the show!

It's awkward and weird, but just enough to keep it interesting. The characters are get annoying, but not so much that you stop loving them. There are surprises around every corner, but they're within "reason", which gives the show a sense of realism rather than an over the top drama.

The actor playing James does a fantastic job. The show has true character development and helps you connect with the characters on a deeper level. Everything they do/say/emote, and more importantly, everything that they don't, adds a lot to every scene.
