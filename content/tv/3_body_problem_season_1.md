Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Having read the first book and loved it, this didn't just exceed my expectations,
but left me memorized.

The characters were crafted perfectly. The graphics and special effects were neither
over nor under done. The balance of tension, relief, story telling and character development
was tip-toeing a tough line, but they nailed it.

It was definitely a 5/5, but I did get the sense that something was missing from making
it an award winning 5/5. I'm hoping that as the actors iterate on their chemistry together
in the next season, we'll get there.

Even though the first season drew elements from books I haven't read yet, I didn't
get the sense that they were spoiling anything. They did justice to the source material,
and more so.

My favorite part is how much the 3 body problem game aligned with how I had imagined it.
I'm not over exaggerating when I say that it was EXACTLY the same.

I genuinely cannot wait for the next season.
