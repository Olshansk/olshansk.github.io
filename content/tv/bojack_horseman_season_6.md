In my honest personal opinion, this is one of the most underrated series I've discovered.

The show defines what character development is, and shows all aspects of it: the euphoric highs and the depressing lows. The breadth of characters also creates a fictional world everyone can relate to. It covers everything from career success to failure, fame and fortune, love and loneliness, sexuality, addiction, death, family problems and so much more. 

It is by far one of the deepest and most powerful TV shows I've found, and manages to remove racial boundaries through the use of animals brilliantly. Most importantly, it reminds us never to take everything too seriously and remember to laugh, because at the end of the day, it's a cartoon about a comedic horse.
