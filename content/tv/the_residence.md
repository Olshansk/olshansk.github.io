Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Easily in my top 5 of 2025, alongside shows like The Gentlemen and The White Lotus.

A modern twist on Sherlock Holmes that deserves a place in the pantheon of great shows in its own right.

An original and refreshing take on the genre, with a diverse cast and a unique storyline.

The plot is engaging. The writing is sharp. The direction is masterful. The cinematography is top-notch. The acting is done to perfection.

I genuinely can‚Äôt wait for Season 2.
