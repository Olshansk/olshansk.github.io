Loot is one of my go-to "I just need to relax and watch something" shows. It won't advance further than that, but I also think I'll keep watching it as long as new episodes keep coming out.

It's fun, original, has a great composed of many Saturday Night Live regulars.

It's not something I'd ever recommend to anyone, but I will keep watching and only have positive things to say.

Nicholas is easily my favorite actor and character :)
