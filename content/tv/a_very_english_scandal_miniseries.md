It's always exciting when something crazy enough to only be fictional is based on a true story.

I love the fact that this was a very short (3 1-hour episode) miniseries rather than a multi-season show or a very long movie. Would love to see this happen more frequently.

The chemistry and performances by Hugh Grant and Ben Wishaw were out of this world.
