Episode 1: It's nostalgic, exciting and action packed. It managed to maintain it's authentic visual and audio aesthetic, while also feeling modern in the scope of other shows that are released nowadays. Most importantly, the show is not afraid of verging on breaking the 4th walll and being funny, while also being very psychologically deep by addressing Jack's inner conflicts.

Episode 2: This episode was the fucking bomb. It's amazing how you can say so much with such little dialogue.

Episodes 3 - 4: I thought the season was off to a good start, but it just keeps getting better. The graphics, as simple as they are, are stunning and really connect with me on a deeper level. Every transition, sound and tree has a purpose. The varying backgrounds from a basic forest, to the inside of a huge organism or just a scene of white snow are beautiful. Most importantly, each such scene serves a unique and critical purpose to the storyline. The inner conflict Samurai Jack is resolving is extremely interesting, and I'm really curious to see where the dynamic with his hostage is going to go.

A beautiful, emotional, meaningful ending. The show culminated in a way that did not disappoint, linking everything back to the very start while keeping the essence of the characters and storyline intact.
