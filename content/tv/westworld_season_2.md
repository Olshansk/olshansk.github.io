In my opinion the second season was much better than the first. At times it felt like they were trying to do too much or seem like they're to achieve an extremely grand vision, but when it all comes together it's simply remarkable.

There are very shows in my life that I'd ever consider rewatching, and westworld is one of them. Moreso, this is one of the few shows that I would be interested in having be converted to a game of thrones style book to really gain an insight into what each character is thinking and feeling.
