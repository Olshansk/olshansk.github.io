You start watching this show because you want to see batman, but you get so much more!

Unlike other superhero shows airing on TV right now, Gotham really stands out in a gruesome, sentimental and enthralling sense. The whole show is an origin story of sorts, that really makes you appreciate the world of gotham beyond just Batman. A strong, very well picked cast, makes the story feel real, even under surreal circumstances. Cheesiness is kept to a minimum, so as only to provide "comic relief" at various times, but this show is otherwise amazing! 

A must watch!
