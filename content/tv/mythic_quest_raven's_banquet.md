Silicon Valley meets Magic Leap: entertaining and cathartic while really hitting home.

As someone who use to live and work in Silicon Valley, I very much enjoyed HBO's Silicon Valley and could relate. Working at Magic Leap's HQ in Florida for 3.5 years is something less people can relate to, but it was truly a magical and dreadful experience at the same time. I think that only those who worked at General Magic would really understand.

This should brings both of those together, so I enjoy it but can also relate to the entire fun/crazy, loving/hateful, energetic/esoteric culture that no one else can understand.

The episode where a robot was writing backstories had a happy ending but it's crazy how only 2 years later, we not have ChatGPT, and really put things into perspective.

The episode where everyone was quarantining seemed like it would be fun to watch as it was coming out, but watching it after COVID ended was too painful and I had to fully skip those episodes.
