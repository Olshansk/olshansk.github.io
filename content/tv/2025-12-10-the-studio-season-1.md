This show is the embodiment of Seth Rogan in a fancy suit.

Funny. Witty. Original. Stylish. Cringy at times, but just enough for it to be entertaining without crossing any lines.

I'm increasingly seeing Seth Rogan in more and more shows, as an actor, director, producer, and writer. He's the definition of what experience, time, age, wisdom and a sprinkle (;)) of talent can do.

This show wasn't just an inside scoop into how Hollywood operates, but it was also a view into what Seth Rogan loves and hates about the industry from a satirical perspective.

I also love how it's an opportunity for him to choose which of his Hollywood friends he gets to cast, make silly jokes with, and rather than buying a bunch of fancy cars, he just gets to rent them.

I loved everything about the show and would recommend it to all my friends.
