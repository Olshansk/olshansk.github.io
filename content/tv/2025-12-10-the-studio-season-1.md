This show is the embodiment of Seth Rogan in a fancy suit.

Funny. Witty. Original. Stylish. Just the right amount of cringe to keep you entertained without drifting into self-parody.

Rogan keeps showing up everywhere lately as actor, director, producer, writer. This show is a prime example of what time, experience, age, and a touch of talent can compound into ;)

The show gives you a peek into how Hollywood works, but it also feels like a tour of what Rogan loves and hates about the industry told through satire.

It also doubles as his playground. He picks which friends to cast, trades inside jokes, and instead of buying expensive cars, he just rents them for the bits.

I loved the whole thing and would recommend it to all my friends.
