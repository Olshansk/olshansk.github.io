The allure of space caught my attention, but I hadn't heard of this show before going into the first season, and it exceeded all my expectations!

The blending of history with fiction is done in a very meticulous and engaging manner. The mix of historical footage, combined with modern computer graphics is on point. The characters have interesting dynamics, nothing is stagnant, and is never boring. The fact that the plot follows a storyline that could very well be an alternate universe, but stays grounded to reality.

I have lots of favorite moments in the first season but this interaction where a russian tried to enter the US moonbase really hit home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h4o-k0XXv0
