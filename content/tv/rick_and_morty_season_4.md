Another hilarious, brilliant and original season of Rick & Morty!

I want to say that it's more of the same, which is the case, but it doesn't do the show justice because every single episode is so so unique.

I love the characters, the plot twists, mind bending concepts and the high paced execution of comedy. There is something funny or witty happening every 30 seconds, and I have no clue how the writers manage to keep it up.

The only things that really stood out are that the first episode of the season made absolutely zero sense and the last episode was a lot more emotional and down to earth than I had ever seen Rick & Morty be. 

This is by far my favorite cartoon and is probably the only one I'm willing to rewatch.
