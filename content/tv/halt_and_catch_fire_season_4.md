(caps not intended but rotten tomatoes is broken at the time of writing this).

This is uone of the most underrated shows on tv, and I can't believe how it flew under the radar from start to finish.

silicon vallye is funny, cathardic, modern and upbeat. This show is true to life, full of love, friendship, grief and challenges.

Throughout a short four seasons, you see all the main characters grow and evolve. You learn to love them like your own family as you embark on their life journey.

Every single characters matters in a completely different way. there are qualities i share, hate and envy in each and every one of them.

this is by far one of my favorite shows and simply left me speechless by the end. It hits really close to home.
