The show set a very high bar with Season 2 & 3. Season 4 kept the momentum going
and kept meeting the standards.

While the season finales of Season 2 & 3 hard to match, we really started exploring
the development of all the characters involved as they age, mature and how a 30
year relationship between two people differs from 5 years.

- Margo learns to understand the difficult decisions her mentor had to make and
  continues sacrificing herself for the good of those around her such as Aleida.
- The heat between Ed & Danielle intensifies and the only reason they manage
  through it is because they have decades of experience to back up their relationship.
- Dev, no matter how rich, leaves behind his home, his family, his team and his legacy
  just to pursue a different life.
- Kelly tries to raise a child under the most difficult circumstances.

At the same time, space travel and working on mars is no longer a dream, but
something people take for granted. Though it's hard to believe, I can see this
being our world in the not too distant future.

This is the first time I watched a season and will have to wait a year for the next
one to come out. I'm already eager for it to start!
