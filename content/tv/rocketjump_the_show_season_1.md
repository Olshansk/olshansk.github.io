Episode 1
-------------

Long time freddiew & rocketjump fan, so I'm really really glad they're doing this. I loved the behind the scenes, meeting the crew, seeing freddie and his partners in action, both filiming in discussing. I love seeing how an idea turns into a story, and how compromises need to be made. I loved learning more about how everyone sees the filming process. It was all interesting and extremely enticing. However, the short itself was only mediocre. Though there were a few stunning scenes that are burnt into my mind (in particular, when the horses start running), and while I'm very impressed by all the different shots and effects they were able put together, the storyline just didn't do it for me. I found it amusing, in particular the scene when they leave the bar, but something is missing. The crew is very talented, but it is still not "TV" quality. That being said, I'm really looking forward to seeing how the other shorts turn out.
