I acknowledge that the multi-verse theme is no longer novel, and may get tiring, but in the meantime, keep it coming!

Dark matter takes matters into its own hands with a dark twist on the multi-verse. Okay, that was a cheeky joke but I couldn't resist :)

The concept of humans being limited from entering superposition due to the observance from our consciousness is brilliant. Taking it a step further, the use of drugs to enable this, along with an endless corridor manifestation is ideal. I could not, in a million years, have thought of a better analogy. In an endless number of universes, I might have though ;).

Overall, the filming, acting, plot-line, length, character development, etc are very well done. The world without an atmosphere really stuck in my head, and I wouldn't have been against exploring more how other words vary, though it does detract from the main storyline.

The only piece missing for me was getting "more" from the leading actors. It may be a lack of chemistry, or time having worked together, but there was something missing. For example, the scene where Jason leaves Amanda in the universe she decides to stay in was powerful, but something was missing. It could have hit a little more.

Other than that, I was amazed by how every single of the leading and supporting actors played completely different personalities under different circumstances. I'm sure that they had a ton of fun doing it and pushing their skills to the limits.

Though Jason and Daniela had the most screen time, I'd have to say that Amanda and Ryan were my favorite characters. I'd love a second season focused on them.

Also, Alice Braga (playing Amanda Lucas) has the most beautiful smile I've ever seen.
