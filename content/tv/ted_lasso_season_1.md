Simply love it. Absolutely exceeds every expectation I had!

At a time when television shows are either very dramatic, cinematic, educational, emotional, romantic, funny, ironic, or mind-bending Ted Lasso stands out as being a feel-good show that really brings a smile to your face by reminding you how important it is to be optimistic, and actually makes it so.

Seeing the clash between characters who are drastically different is entertaining, but also a good reminder that everyone in life is dealing with a lot that others may not be able to comprehend. It is a reminder that we all have friends & family to whom we can provide or look to for support, and with whom we can celebrate both small and big wins.
