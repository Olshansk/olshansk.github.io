Something weird happened with the episode reviews here, so they may be out of order and I also have duplicates for some reason...

Episode 1
-------------

Rick has become a hardcore badass that doesnt take chances. Daryl has softened up and open his arms. Carol just freaks me out. That old character came back. He is a mysterious being whom I want to learn more about. Everyone has identified their role. Everyones characters have been molded and shaped into who they are not. Now its just time to execute, move on and survive. The show has had a lot of character development over the past couple seasons, and Im beginning to want to see some closure.

On a side note, I love it when directors can to play around and experiment with different styles of shooting. The black & white / color switches were a pleasant change and made the episode very easy to follow.

Episode 2
--------------

Very dark. Very gorry. This is why I love the walking dead. It showed everyone's true nature and ability to overcome obstacles and survive. It was also an easy way to kill of all the extra characters that were added in via Alexandria.

Episode 3
--------------

A pretty slow and boring episode for the most part with a very clear message: Anyone can get left behind if there is no other choice. Not very exciting until the very end where the writers surprised me by killing off a character I thought was untouchable.

Episode 4
--------------

As much as I do love origin stories, this one was very one sided. It must've been a year or two since they last saw each other, and so much could have happened. The whole story was surrounded around one particular set of events and could have expanded into so much more. While parts of it were definitely interesting and intriguing, I was hoping for more...

Episodes 5 - 8
-------------------

The Walking Dead did it again with Glen's return. I just couldn't believe it. Other than that though, nothing much has happened. I get it, everyone is said and scared. Everyone wants a better future and doesn't know how to get there, but we've seen this before and the only thing that has changed are the supporting roles. It was nonetheless entertaining and I hope that what feels like a build up won't let me down.

Oh yea, that tower fell, I wonder what will happen next.

Episode 9
-------------

Probably one of my favorite episodes to my recent recollection of the show. I loved the thrill, the suspense, and the action. So many of our favorite characters were on the edge of getting killed in some way but managed to dodge a bullet (both literally and figuratively) last second. The show killed of some of the minor characters whose story I didn't really see going anywhere, and for that I am grateful. I also loved the cinematography and vibrant explosions; not something we typically see on The Walking Dead. Overall, this episode was simply amazing!

Episode 10
---------------
Two consecutive episodes couldn't be any more different. While episode 9 was filled with anxiety, thrill and danger, episode 10 was filled with self-reflection, trickery, and character development. Everyone goes through hard times and looks for different ways to express their emotions; both through friendship and love. Rick and Daryl are bros. It's amazing how close they've grown over the years. Carl lost an eye, but he's still a helpless teen trying to figure out his place in a helpless world. Throughout the episode I questioned if something could happen between Rick and Michonne, and I was not disappointed. I also can't wait to learn more about this Jesus guy!

Episode 11
---------------
Great episode. Rather than settling in a place, trying to protect it, and then move on, we finally see some original ideas! Multiple camps, different types of communities, trades. As Abraham, who is going through some changes, said, it's a Brave New World!

Episode 12
---------------
A dark, thrilling, action-filled episode with a twist at the end! I love what all the characters have morphed into over the years and can't wait to see what happens next!

Episode 9
-------------
 Dont think. Just eat. A slow episode that finally addresses both physical and mental tolls that a the life of the walking dead can take. From hunger, to anger, and sadness, and replete with lethargy, the limitations of a real human being are finally addressed; emotionally and physically. The crew grows pessimistic, but manages to hold on to hope by a thin thread. As always though, there are some surprises.

Episode 10
---------------
 The moment I finally realized that the writers intentionally inject specific statements to misrepresent the the plot of the next episode. Slow episode where nothing really happened only built to portray Rick's lacks of ability to trust anyone else in this world. Alluding to something or just paranoid? That is the question.

Episode 11
---------------
I'm beginning to wonder who the bad guys are.

Episode 12
----------------
A very well directed episode that manages to make Alexandria feel too safe, even for the audience. The new conditions, and scenes we would not traditionally expect from the walking dead make you let your guard down, only to bring you closer to the characters in the show and make you feel as though the ambience safety is artificial.

Episode 13
----------------
Another great episode from the series in a suprisingly great season. We see that no matter how strong you've become, killing other people is never easy. While I also do love our main heroes, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between who the good and bad guys are.

Episode 14: 
---------------
Eugene has brilliant ideas and grows as a character. Carol can't handle what she's has to do and left, but I expect her to come back. Sasha and Abraham are finally getting it on. Daryl has grown from a badass to a super badass. The writing, character growth and plot twists are absolutely amazing.

One thing I love about this show is that, weirdly, a show. Zombie movies can only go into so much depth and show so much story. The transformation of the main team, the members themselves and the members its composed of, was very gradual and natural. Seeing someone go from a normal world to a killer in 2 hours would seem unbelievable, but I was able to experience every single step that these characters had to endure. I am no longer sure whether they're good or bad, righteous or evil, but I know that they've always had to do what they need to survive. They care about each other, and that shows compassion. They kill others out of their love for each other, as much as they might hate it. I feel like I've made a bond with them and am part of their family.

Episode 15
---------------
One of the slower episodes of the season that keeps reaffirming the types of personalities our characters have grown into. The taciturn Carol is a born killer. The steadfast Rick just keeps on charging. The seemingly unemotional Daryl cant withhold his emotions. The ending literally made me gasp and jump out of my seat.

Episode 16
---------------

Holy Fuck.
