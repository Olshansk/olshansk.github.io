After many years, Black Mirror comes back and does not disappoint. Once again, it's on point.

Even as the world got darker and things are becoming true with the advent of AI,
Black Mirror still finds a great way to tiptoe scientific fiction with reality,
while providing a unique psychological thrill.

The only thing I can say that I haven't mentioned in previous Black Mirror reviews
is that certain episodes can apply to a much broader audience than you expect.

In particular, I recommended the movie episode to my parents, and they loved it!
At the same time, I know they'd never watch some of the darker ones. Being able
to target such a wide audience is a testament to the brilliance of the show.
