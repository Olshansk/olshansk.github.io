- If I was hesitatnt to recommend season 1, there is zero hesitation to recommend season 3
- Every season gets better and better
- The mule grows on you as the perfect characters
- The emspire actors are getting better
- It makes you reflect on the power of nurture and circumstance
- You feel for Dermazel
- The main female character is the next go to for narration
- The asthetics of some seasons blow me away
- You can tell the budget went up
