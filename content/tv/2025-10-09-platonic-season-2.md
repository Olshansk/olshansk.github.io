The season 2 I wasn't expecting but happy I got.

There have been a handful of times when I show I enjoyed was left on a cliff hanger, and never renewed, leaving a gap that will never be filled.

The first season of platonic ended on a good note, and I wasn't expecting a second season, so it was a pleasant surprise.

Season 1 had a subtle and well crafted tension between a romantic and platonic relationship between two close friends. Season 2 was all about a completely platonic relationship, with no tinge of romanticism, but co-dependence that exceeds any familiar or romantic relationship.

It was JUST the right about of cringey, teasing the boundary of funny, yet still fun and entertaining.

It made me reflect on what's important to me, and what I can do to help those around me progress on what's important to them.
