A stunning and mesmerizing journey that touches on each each sense and emotion.

The tale of a lonely man in his 40s, who lost his mother and trying to amend a relationship with his brother is touching and heartbreaking. The references to the cold war space race was nostalgic.

But, all of that was just a medium to explore and deliver Robert Lepage's vision for a surrealistic experience. He made Requiem for a Dream come to life. If Salvador Dalí were to write and direct a play, it would have a similar vibe.

You feel like you traveled back into the 1990s.

You hear things like:

> Life's a. Bitch and then you die.

And then:

> I'm loud and I'm not going to make a fool of myself

And you try to unpack how it makes you feel, but then the play turns into a blend of terror and emotion.

The way the stage blended video, sound, puppets, light, mirrors, acoustics and everything else makes it a masterpiece.

When the main character missed his talk after flying all the way to Moscow, I almost cried.

I can spend more time talking about the plot, but I wouldn't do it justice. You have to go see it.

The [The Far Side of the Moon](https://www.canadianstage.com/show/the-far-side-of-the-moon) was the performance of a life time with one man on stage, but a dozen to make it happen.

I hadn't heard of Robert Lepage prior to this, but I am grateful this world was opened to me.
