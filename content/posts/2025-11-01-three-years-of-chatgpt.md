- I worked in the space of crypto in AI before ChatGPT
- I started using it on Day 1
- Show screenshot of github copilot on day 1
- Following simon willison is unparalleled
- Didn't believe the turnig test would be past - it did
- Didn't believe agents - it did
- A lot of what I didn't believe has happened
- I use clude code, codex, chatgpt
- I have not switched

Things I don't use enough:

- AI browser
- voice mode
- Deep research
- 3rd party tools (i code things up)

Why was I burnt

- AR glasses
- VR moment in COIV
- Waymo - it was good in 2019, but it's probably very different now
- Blockchain, 2016

I was burnt for a reaon
