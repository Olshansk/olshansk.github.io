I've just updated my site to use the PaperMod theme. This clean, minimal design better showcases my book reviews, movie reviews, and TV show reviews while maintaining a focus on content.

## What's New

- **Cleaner Design**: A minimal, focused interface
- **Better Organization**: Separate sections for posts, books, movies, and shows
- **Search Functionality**: Find any review quickly
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes for late-night reading

Stay tuned for more posts and reviews!
