### *Edit: 08/04/2024 - These instructions are applicable if you have one of the newer versions of Chrome installed.*
Chrome changed a lot of things recently so the settings from the first “Use Apps, Not Tabs” are no longer applicable.

The final result gives lets me easily “cmd + tab” between all the different AI platforms out there.

- There are now two different ways to go about it.

#### 1. Install “…” Option Available
I wanted to install [meta.ai](https://www.meta.ai/) as a separate application. After clicking "⋮" → “Save and Share” → “Install Meta AI”, things were flawlessly out of the box.

#### 2. Install “…” Option Unavailable
I’m not completely sure what distinguishes a website that has an “Install” option from one that doesn’t, but as an example, this infor page from meta does not: [ai.meta.com/blog/segment-anything-2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/segment-anything-2/).

In this scenario, after clicking "⋮" → “Save and Share” → “Install Page as App”, what I had to do was:

Go to [chrome://apps](http://chrome://apps/)

- Right-click on the application

- Check the “Open in window” option

- QED

### *Edit: 08/04/2024 - These instructions are likely outdated unless you have an old version of chrome installed.*
*tl;dr Follow the instructions on [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Turn-Your-Favorite-Website-Into-Desktop-Apps-With-Google-Chrome) (or the gif below) to turn any website into a “Native Desktop Application.”*

One of the first things I did when ChatGPT first came out (more than a year ago) was turn [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/) into its own *“Desktop Application.”* This lets you simply `Command + Tab` across open applications without the pain of opening the browser and finding “*that tab,” *or worse, opening up a new one.

Here’s a screenshot of the open applications on my computer as I’m writing this:

I don’t remember where I first learned about this, but [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Turn-Your-Favorite-Website-Into-Desktop-Apps-With-Google-Chrome) has a guide on it, so I’d argue it has passed the stage of esoteric knowledge.

In my humble opinion, I believe this is a very underutilized but very powerful chrome feature. **I hope it helps you avoid death by a thousand tabs, so use Apps, not Tabs.**
