UofT Interview
Meeting with students

- What UofT taught me:
  - You can learn any subject you want
  - School is short-term, it is about doing things yourself (if you can)
  - Work is long-term, you need to build a team, relationships, roots, etc…
  - School is a sprint with breaks in between
  - Work is a marathon with interspresed sprints
- Do you still need a degree
- Yes: we used to say eveyrth
- Patience
  - Still working on this myself
  - Naval: "impatience with actions, patience with results”
- Relationships:
  - Don’t forget to build relationships along the way
  - “It’s Not What You Know. It's Who You Know"
  - It’s both
- IQ vs EQ:
  - 5-15: IQ (ability) - start
  - 15-25: Skills (knowledge) - camera
  - 25+: EQ (action) - action
- Toolbox:
  - Every experience or skill you learn is something you put in your toolbox
  - More experience -> more tools
  - Leadership is knowing which tool to use
  - Inexperience is applying the tool you have
- Introspection
  - Daniel Ek: “Know yourself”
  - What time do you work or like to have meetings?
  - I know people who went risk on right out of college
  - I know those who went to a big company
  - There is no right path, it’
  - Do what helps you build confidence
  - Trust yourself and build conviction in yourself.
  - The important thing is not to stagnate
  - If you’re comfortable, make a change.
    - Externalitities (e.g. getting fired) helps
  - Tradeoffs: Money, learning, experience, fun, opportunity.
- Compensation:
  - Very heavily weighted towards later in your career.
  - Do not optimize for this early on
  - Hard to go back once you’re accustomed to a certain lifestyle
  - Munger: “Show me the incentives and I’ll show you the results”
