### **GATE**: Gateway Abstraction Technical Elements — Annotated Presentation

I recently gave a talk at [dinfra.xyz](https://dinfra.xyz/), a side event hosted by [1kx.capital](https://1kx.capital/) alongside Denver’s annual [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) conference.

In my honest opinion, this is the most serious and highest-quality side event of the week.. It bridges ideas related to decentralized systems, cryptography in and out of web3 (aka “crypto” space).

The [list of speakers](https://dinfra.xyz/) includes individuals like Kurt Rohloff (founder of [openfhe.org](https://openfhe.org/)), Sam Williams (founder of [Arweave](https://arweave.org/)), Ed Felten (Princeton University Professor and co-founder of [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/)), among many others. The opportunity to share a stage with these individuals is an honor.
