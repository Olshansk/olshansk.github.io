_Snap! Smile! Turn around! Look here!_

On a sunny day, with a breath of fresh air,
I took a short walk, on an off-day winter holiday,
Witnessing families, both large and small, capturing memories on a casual stroll.

These snapshots may sync to the cloud, or begin to traverse,
Soaring about, sometimes emerging to the *Meta*verse,
But without a digital frame, they often linger, forgotten, out and about.

If the photo stands out, it'll likely be aired,
But if not all are in frame, it may fade out, uncared.

_On a special day, or when you’re travelling away,
In a distant place, you might seek a stranger's grace.
But on ordinary days, whether the sun is shining or just a muted grey,
You move along, untroubled by fray._

_Then, on a typical day, close to home, perhaps near the bay,
You snap a few shots, preparing to resume your way.
Suddenly, a stranger approaches with a friendly stand:
“May I take a photo of your group today?”
An unexpected gesture, a moment of pause,
But then you think, you've never had a family portrait here, just because._

---

Everyone gathers, smiling wide,
A fleeting moment, now captured to abide.
A memory for today, for eternity, a treasure to guide.

So, next time you spot someone nearby,
Passing around the phone, capturing memories, as if in a merry-go-round,
Reach out, extend a hand, snap a frame,
Be the one who helps a family create a memory.
