- Blockchain distributed ledger
- Mom while hiking
- Master class in software leadership
- Lots of things to discuss one day
- Super transparent
- My mom loved it
- I told her its a masterclass
- He sounds very patient on podcasts - is that how he is in all aspects of life?
- Fun story about getting audited as a 19 year old and then tell the IRS was wrong
- How much of it is "best effort" vs "has to be good?" E.g. I paid crypto taxes in 2016 while trading on dexes JUST FOR FUN, and only LATER realizing each one is a taxable event
