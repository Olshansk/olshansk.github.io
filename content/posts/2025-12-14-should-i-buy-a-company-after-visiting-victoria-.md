I took a ferry from Seattle to Victoria, and all I could think about on the way back is: **Which company I should buy (not build) to generate free cash flow?**

If you're a seasoned software engineer in the age of AI reading this, you're probably thinking how ridiculous this is.

Well, [Andrew](https://x.com/awilkinson) planted a [tiny](https://tiny.com/) seed into my mind, and it has started germinating.

Strap in, because this post is about making plans without expectations, and how that extends into everything else in life.

## Discovering Never Enough

I first learnt about Andrew on [episode 63 of the Acquirer's Podcast](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/04/ep-63-the-acquirers-podcast-andrew-wilkinson-berkshire-com-how-tiny-is-building-the-berkshire-of-the-internet/) back in the heat of COVID lockdown.

As a long-time value investor and student of Warren Buffet, the analogy I'd use is that Andrew is the **"Oracle of Victoria"** in Canada, and [Tiny.com](https://tiny.com/) is the Berkshire Hathaway of Tiny businesses spanning from coffee makers like [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/) to movie review sites like [Letterboxed](https://letterboxd.com/).

Somewhere along the way between 2020 and now, I started reading [Andrew's blog](https://www.neverenough.com/newsletter), listening to [his podcast](https://www.neverenough.com/podcast), finding him on a handful of others podcasts like [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/), and sheleved his book: [Never Enough: From Barista to Billionaire](https://neverenough.co/).

If you ever listen to any of his public appearances or read his block, he has an open invite to grab a coffee with anyone who makes their way to Victoria.

I figured I'd take him up on tha toffer.

## Make plans without expectatiosn

Since Andrew's blog first came out, I replied to over half a dozen of his emails.

No one has time for random messages, so one day I was direct with my ask. Paraphrasing some unnecessary comments I added: "Can we meet up if I visit Vancouver?"

After a few followups, his assistant jumpig in, and lots of patience, I got invited to Victoria's Enetrepneruship Lunch Cub (ELC).

Though I was originally hoping for a 1:1 coffee, lunch or sauna session, I figured there would be a ton of interesting people at this event and was pumped.

I figure out some logistics, grab the black friday deal from [clippervacations.com](https://www.clippervacations.com) for a ferry and a two night stay at a hotel, and deided I'd make a whole vacation out of it.

I take the Ferry Thursday morning and arrive in Victoria at 11am. Feels like a Canadian version of Manchester.

I wake my way to the hotel and ask about a flyer they have related to [Butchart Gardens](butchartgardens.com/). After a long hot shower, I decide to buy a pass and have a mesmorizing evening filled with colors and light. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting during the holidays.

While I way, I explore the city and discover [Fan Tan Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley), the narrowest commercial street in North America that's only 3 feet wide.

I wake up to a text from my friend, the founder of [Shinzo Labs](https://shinzolabs.com) that he took me up on the offer to crash at my hotel. I said I got him an invite to ELC as well, but he neve confirmed, so I just let it go. I work out, he shows up, and we start making our way over to [Part and Parcel](https://www.partandparcel.ca).

Along the way, we find [Epic Games & More](https://www.epicgamesvic.com/), which was a fun and overhwleming blast of Nostaligia and childhood from video games to Pokemon cards.

When I show up at Part and Parcel, I didn't get the memo that need to be at least 6 feet to tall to be part of ELC.

Jokes aside, we dive straight into a conversation and my first conversation was with someone expanding their in-person fitness brand that's focused on mobility and longevity. As someone who has experience many physical traumas in their life, I loved it.

Once the officiall event kicks off, the first thing I hear is: **"Andrew won't be able to make it today."**

My heart sinks a bit, but it's alright, I'm already having a great time.

Newcomers get to introduce themselves to the group, and everyone can share wins if they have them.

With about 30-40 people in total, each table had 4-6 people, and there are two rules:

1. One conversation per table
2. Discuss the topic provided

I sit down at a table of people I've never met or heard of before. Very quickly, I realize I'm surrounded by extremeley seasoned entrepeneurs.

- Anniya: Health
- Claire: ADHD
- Rajeev: investor
- Big guy
- Scard guy

As we leave, I ask ed Rajeev if he knows where/how I can reach Andrew, and he suggested I text him as he adds me to the ELC WhatsApp Group.

I figured the group will have names tied to the numbers, but alas, I was wrong. I try to Google the numbers of all the admins, but can't find anything pointing to Andrew.

I end up sending a "Hey Andrew" number to a couple of people, including one of the Admins, who points me in the right direction. I send him a message on WhatsApp and the waiting game begings agan.

As my friend and I head out, I remember Andrew's last newsletter mentioning a local comedian who had a show that evening. As a lover of comedy and improv, I was thinking of attending it either, and figured there'd be a non-zero chance I can run into Andrew there as well.

We go to the [Late Night Show with Nash Park](https://www.lamppostsocial.com/events/the-late-night-show-with-nash-park-72445). The show had it's moments (both good and bad), but I appreciated every skit and would recommend it to anyone.

We didn't run into Andrew, but it was a successfull day nontheless.

My friend and I grab a slice of pizza and head back to the hotel

The next day, I wake up, head to the gym, and get a response! We set up a time to meet at a local coffee shop.

The conversation was a ton of fun and the hour flew by. Since I know a lot about Andrew's story, I got to share some of mine. We covered how Vyvanse is an open secret for anyone with ADHD, alongside other parts of our supplement stack. If you're an entrepenuer, you're likely a workaholic, which comes with having an addictive personality. This translates into other types of addictions in life, both good and bad.

Crypto Investors:

- Pump and dump
- Goal: Creating value
- Investors: Extract value
- Not okay: Simply redistributing value

## Should I buy a company?

By the end of our conversation, Andrew could tell I have ambitions to build impactful companies founded on deep-tech, but I don't have the financial freedom I need to do that effectively.

That's when he planted a seed: why not buy an existing company, cleanup the operations, cut the burn, and milk the cigar butt for everything that remains.

At first, I questioned how there could be a revenue generating company that needs this much help.

Companies require luck, and doing a true zero-to-one is non-trivial. Some people perceverse their way into it, while others

There are plenty of founders who got lucky, are tired, and would be happy to let go for the price for someone to come in and cleanup their mess in exchange for some liquidity. Let's see if [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) on [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideproject/) comes up with anything.

There are also a lot of people in the older generation who might have built up a small business over years, or decades, and don't know what to do with. I don't think a reddit post would do, but I'm contemplating putting an ad in the paper :thinking_emoji:.

For the longest time, I've also thought of starting another company in the construction space, after [my first one (GetSoils)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getsoils/posts/?feedView=images&viewAsMember=true) didn't quite work out. Rather than selling AI tech to these companies, maybe buying them and automating internal processes E2E using AI-enabled tech is the play.

## Showing Up and Building Relationships

There's a well know proverb:

> "It's Not What You Know. It's Who You Know."

In my person opinion, it's not one or the other, but it's both. It's the only way to achieve anything great

There are two things I've changed my mind on over the past few years as I've been embarcking on my entrepreunrship journey:

1. Relationships rule the world
2. You can only build relationships in person

One thing I've changed my mind on over the past few years is the importance

## Making things happn

- Make a plan, have goals, but don’t have expectations and make the best out of any situation.
- One of my biggest learnings this year was “letting it go”. I would’ve been okay not seeing Andrew, but I’m very grateful we made the time for coffee
- Be flexible. Adapt. Make the best out of every situation. Build relationships.

## Travel Recommendations

This is just an aggregated list of the things I did and enjoyed in case you're planning a trip to Victoria yourself.

- **Comedy**: [Jump Comedy](https://www.jumpcomedy.com) and [Ok Dope](https://www.ok-dope.com/)
- **Nature**: [Butchart Gardens](https://butchartgardens.com/)
- **Tourism**: [Fan Tan Allye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley) in Chinatown
- **Nerdy**: [Epic Games & More](https://www.epicgamesvic.com/)
- **Food**: [Al Barak Medeternian](https://albarakvictoria.com/)

If you're travelling from Seattle, I recommend getting a pacakge from [FRS Clipper](https://www.clippervacations.com/) that'll have the ferry there and back, as well as put you in a good hotel. I stayed at the [Best Western Plus Carlton Plaza Hotel](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-victoria/best-western-plus-carlton-plaza-hotel/propertyCode.62063.html) and loved it. The location, service, room and gym were all great. Clipper also validates your parking at [Republic Parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e7ccWQeV7fi3ctx26) so you only pay $10/day.

If you're an entrepenruer, reach out to Andrew and his team at [Never Enough](https://www.neverenough.com/). You won't regret it.
