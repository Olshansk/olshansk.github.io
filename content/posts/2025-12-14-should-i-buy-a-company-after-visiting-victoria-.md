I took a ferry from Seattle to Victoria, and all I could think about on the way back was: **Which company should I buy (not build) to generate free cash flow?**

If you're a seasoned software engineer in the age of AI who lives to build, you're probably thinking how ridiculous this is.

Well, [Andrew Wilkinson](https://x.com/awilkinson) planted a [tiny](https://tiny.com/) seed in my mind, and it has started germinating.

Strap in: this post is about making plans without expectations, how that extends into everything else in life, and if you're a swiftie, I got something special at the end for you as well.

## Discovering "Never Enough"

I first found out about Andrew on [episode 63 of the Acquirer's Podcast](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/04/ep-63-the-acquirers-podcast-andrew-wilkinson-berkshire-com-how-tiny-is-building-the-berkshire-of-the-internet/) back in the heat of COVID lockdown.

As a long-time value investor and student of Warren Buffet, the analogy I'd use is that Andrew is the **"Oracle of Victoria"** in Canada, and [Tiny.com](https://tiny.com/) is the Berkshire Hathaway of Tiny businesses spanning from coffee makers like [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/) to movie review sites like [Letterboxed](https://letterboxd.com/).

As rotten as Rotten Tomatoes is though, I'm too deeply invested in my profile here 🍅

![Rotten Tomatoes](/images/posts/should-i-buy-a-company-after-visiting-victoria/rotten_tomatoes.png)

Somewhere along the way between 2020 and now, I started reading [Andrew's blog](https://www.neverenough.com/newsletter), listening to [his podcast](https://www.neverenough.com/podcast), finding him on a handful of others podcasts like [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/), and sheleved his book: [Never Enough: From Barista to Billionaire](https://neverenough.co/).

If you ever listen to any of his public appearances or read his block, he has an open invite to grab a coffee. All you need to do is [fly out to Victoria](https://youtu.be/0T8bJuH60qU?si=DVW22pyse4z5_EBO&t=7625).

Luckily, I just needed to take a ferry instead of a plane 🛳

## Make plans without expectatiosn

Since Andrew's blog first came out, I replied to over half a dozen of his emails.

Even though my messages were sometimes witty, fun or insightful, busy people don't have time to get distracted by everyone's two cents, even if they're made of gold coins.

One day, I was a lot more deliberate and direct with my ask (I paraphrase): _"Can we meet if I get a ticket to Victoria?"_

After a couple of followups, lots of patience, and a bit of luck, his assistant jumped in. I got invited to Victoria's Enetrepneruship Lunch Club (ELC).

Though I was originally hoping for a 1:1 with Andrew (coffee, lunch or sauna session), I figured there would be a ton of interesting people at this event, and was equally pumped.

I planned out some logistics, grabbed the black friday deal from [clippervacations.com](https://www.clippervacations.com) for a roundtrip ferry, a two night stay, and decided I'd make a whole mini-vacation out of it. Best part: I had no plans other than that lunch.

I took the Ferry Thursday morning and arrived in Victoria at 11am. As I walked to my hotel, the vibe I got was like a Canadian version of Manchester.

At the hotel, I saw a flyer for [Butchart Gardens](butchartgardens.com/). Turns out it's one of Victoria's most iconic landmarks, and they were having a christmas special

I bought a ticket and had some time to kill. I started exploring the city and discover [Fan Tan Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley), the narrowest commercial street in North America that's only 3 feet wide.

I go to Butchart Gardens, and caught up with some friends over the phone as I was walking around the beautiful gardens, with mesmerizing colors, and some funny exhibitions.

The next morning, as I head down to the gym, I wake up to a text from my friend Austin, the founder at [Shinzo Labs](https://shinzolabs.com). I invited him to tag along for ELC, and he took me up on that last minute offer to crash at my hotel. I work out, he shows up, and we start making our way over to [Part and Parcel](https://www.partandparcel.ca).

Along the way, we discovered [Epic Games & More](https://epicgamesvic.com/). It was a fun and overhwleming blast of Nostaligia and childhood from video games to Pokemon cards. The world of cards and collectibles amazes me because it's the clearest textbook example of the power of branding, and the importance of human emotion in product design. Some Pokemon cards go for hundreds of dollars, and apparently Marvel vs Capcom 2 for Xbox is also a collectible, which I might actually have lying around somewhere.

When we show up at Part and Parcel, Austin and I joke that we didn't get the memo that you need need to be at least 6 feet to tall to be part of ELC 🙃.

We dive straight into a conversation with some of the other entpreneurs. Someone just moved to Victoria from Vancouver to expand their in-person fitness brand that's focused on mobility, longevity, and not posting things on instagram. As someone who used to go to the ER every year until the age of 18, followed by some "career ending" injures in my 20s, I loved it.

The official event kicks off and the first thing I hear is: **"Andrew won't be able to make it today."**

My heart sinks a bit... I made it all this way to meet him. But, the group there is so great that I decide to make the best of it.

Newcomers introduce themselves to the group, share a fun fact, and anyone at the event can share a win. One guy speaks up saying "my investment in SpaceX at $30B looks like it'll be alright" a day after the rumors came out that they're looking to IPO at $1.5T next year. _I paraphrase for some dramatic effect, but you get the point._

With about 30-40 people in total, we split into groups of 4-6, and there are two rules:

1. One conversation per table
2. Discuss the topic provided on the cards

I quickly realize that I'm surrounded by extremeley seasoned entrepeneurs. One person is bulding a company that has promising results to cure a form of cancer, another built a successful app for management of anxiety, adtech, identity tech, and so much more. Everyone but one individual has ADHD, we all (mostly) relate, but that conversation ran a tad too long IMO.

As we leave, I asked Rajeev, whom I was sitting next to, if he knew where/how I can reach Andrew. He added me to the ELC WhatsApp Group.

I figured the group will have names tied to the numbers, but alas, I was wrong. I try to Google the numbers of all the admins, but couldn't find anything pointing to Andrew.

I end up sending a "Hey Andrew" number to a couple of people, including one of the Admins, who ultimately directed me to the right person. I sent Andrew a message on WhatsApp and the patience game begins again.

As Austin and I head out, he mentions there's a chance Andrew will be at a comedy event that evening. I remember Andrew's last newsletter mentioning a local comedian who had a show that evening. As a lover of comedy, and an occassinoal improv practitioner, I was thinking of attending it either way. I get a ticket, and spend a few hours at a nearby Starbucks doing some work.

We go to the [Late Night Show with Nash Park](https://www.lamppostsocial.com/events/the-late-night-show-with-nash-park-72445). The show had it's moments (both good and bad), but I appreciated every skit and would recommend it to anyone visiting the city.

We didn't run into Andrew, but I'd call the day a success. We grab a late night slice of pizza and crash at the hotel for my last night.

The next day, I wake up, and as usual, head to the gym. As I'm jumping some rope, I get a response from Andrew! We set up a time to meet at a local coffee shop.

## Should I buy a company?

We meet up at [Hey Happy](https://www.heyhappycoffee.com/), and get straight into the conversation.

Since I know basically every Andrew has ever shared publically about himself via his book, blogs or poscasts, I got to share a bit about myself.

We dived into how Vyvanse is an open secret to "hapinness" for anyone with ADHD, alongside other parts of our supplement stack. At one point he took about a dozen pills out of his pocket and put them on the table. As someone who's been starting looking into Protein Powder, Creating and BCAA back in 2005, I thought: "This is my guy."

If you're an entrepenuer, you're likely a workaholic, which comes with having an addictive personality. This translates into other types of addictions in life, both good and bad. I wrote a bit more about this topic [here](./../thoughts/2025-12-23-addiction-adhd-discipline-and-obsession.md).

By the end of our conversation, Andrew could tell I have ambitions to build impactful companies founded on deep-tech, but he could also tell I don't have the financial freedom to do so effectively.

That's when he planted a seed: why not buy an existing company, cleanup the operations, cut the burn, and milk the cigar butt for everything that remains.

At first, I questioned how there could be a revenue generating company that needs this much help.

Companies require founders with a vision, grit, persistence, tolernace for pain and an ability to adapt. They require timing, value, doing a real zero-to-one, with a sprinkle of luck.

Then I realized that there are plenty of founders who had a good run in a particular corner at a particular time, and would be happy to let go if the price (and several other things) are right. There are also a lot of people in the older generation who might have built up a small business over years, or decades, and don't know what to do with.

In fact, for a software company, this is easier than ever today:

1. Review your expenses and cleanup anything you don't need
2. Move your cloud expenditures to bare metal
3. Automate a few things with AI workflows
4. Scale down the team to a bare minimum

If you're starting with a product that generates revenue and provides value, the playbook is quite simple.

This is basically what private equity does, but there's a huge opportunity for a consulting shop that focuses on this without any interest in scaling up the business.

## Showing Up, Building Relationships, Enjoying Every Momenet and Making Things Happen

This trip was very fun because it was one of those things where everything worked out as well as it could, even though I had no plan and accepted that my original goal was going to be unfilled.

It was a reason to be grateful and reflect. I had a very rough plan, one simple goal, but no expectations.

One of the weakensses I've adapted around over the last few years is being more adaptive, flexible and lettings things go.

I wasn't planning on exploring Victoria, visiting Butchar Gardens, going to the comedy show, or having anyone accompany me on this mini adventure, but I was planning to meet Andrew.

Up until the morning of the day I was supposed to leave, expectations didn't meet reality, but I enjoyed every moment nontheless.

With that, I kept asking, texting and trying to make things happen. Ultimately, instead of doing a lunch with a lot of other people, I had the opportunity of spending an hour with Andrew in a 1:1 setting. I got to know him as a person beyond his public persona (which isn't so different), and he got to know me.

I met a ton of other cool people along the way and couldn't have asked formore.

If you're one of the people I met on this trip, and you somehow made it this deep into the post - thank you!

## Reflecting on something I should've said better

You know how sometimes you say something in a public setting that you realize you could have framed better after the fact?

Yea, I did that at Victoria's ELC...

One of the topics we were supposed to discuss was: **"What is something you want to do less off?"**

My pompous answer was: **"Spend less time talking to investors."**

It's a great way to dig your own grave as you sit in a circle surrounded by either present or future investors.

I figured I need to clear things up as someone who has some, but not extensive experience here.

I'm going to oversimplify by bucketing this into camps:

1. Always be raising and never say no to money when people are willing to give it to you
2. Focus on bootstrapping a sustainble company and raise fast to scale if/when you need tos

Both of these require relatinoship building to a parallel thread that never stops. If you do it with interesting and genuine people, it doesn't even feel like work.

However, having spent several years deep in the crypto industries, I've had a lot of conversations with people whose values misalign with mine, and been burnt by it.

I'm not interested in quick turnarounds. I'm not interested in pump and dump schemes. I'm not interested in zero-sum-businesses that redistribute value rather than creating net-new value.

I've had tons of conversations where people want to invest without asking me what the product is. I periodically have conversations where people ask if I can build X for a quick pump-and-dump.

I'm all in for moving fast and focusing on near-term execution and revenue generation, but I believe ROI for investors should come when we've created real value.

_Hopefully I'm not burning any bridges here..._

## Victoria Travel Recommendations

This is a quick list of the palces I visited for anyone who wants to repeat my trip.

- **Comedy**: [Jump Comedy](https://www.jumpcomedy.com) and [Ok Dope](https://www.ok-dope.com/)
- **Nature**: [Butchart Gardens](https://butchartgardens.com/)
- **Tourism**: [Fan Tan Allye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley) in Chinatown
- **Nerdy**: [Epic Games & More](https://www.epicgamesvic.com/)
- **Food**: [Al Barak Medeternian](https://albarakvictoria.com/)

If you're travelling from Seattle, I recommend getting a pacakge from [FRS Clipper](https://www.clippervacations.com/) that'll have the ferry there and back, as well as put you in a good hotel. I stayed at the [Best Western Plus Carlton Plaza Hotel](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-victoria/best-western-plus-carlton-plaza-hotel/propertyCode.62063.html) and loved it. The location, service, room and gym were all great. Clipper also validates your parking at [Republic Parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e7ccWQeV7fi3ctx26) so you only pay $10/day.

If you're an entrepenruer, reach out to Andrew and his team at [Never Enough](https://www.neverenough.com/). You won't regret it.
