I took a ferry from Seattle to Victoria, and all I could think about on the way back is: **Which company I should buy (not build) to generate free cash flow?**

If you're a seasoned software engineer in the age of AI reading this, who lives to build, you're probably thinking how ridiculous this is.

Well, [Andrew Wilkinson](https://x.com/awilkinson) planted a [tiny](https://tiny.com/) seed into my mind, and it has started germinating.

Strap in, because this post is about making plans without expectations, how that extends into everything else in life, and if you're a swiftie, I got something in there for you as well.

## Discovering "Never Enough"

I first found out about Andrew on [episode 63 of the Acquirer's Podcast](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/04/ep-63-the-acquirers-podcast-andrew-wilkinson-berkshire-com-how-tiny-is-building-the-berkshire-of-the-internet/) back in the heat of COVID lockdown.

As a long-time value investor and student of Warren Buffet, the analogy I'd use is that Andrew is the **"Oracle of Victoria"** in Canada, and [Tiny.com](https://tiny.com/) is the Berkshire Hathaway of Tiny businesses spanning from coffee makers like [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/) to movie review sites like [Letterboxed](https://letterboxd.com/).

As rotten as Rotten Tomatoes is though, I'm too deeply invested in my profile here 🍅

![Rotten Tomatoes](/images/posts/should-i-buy-a-company-after-visiting-victoria/rotten_tomatoes.png)

Somewhere along the way between 2020 and now, I started reading [Andrew's blog](https://www.neverenough.com/newsletter), listening to [his podcast](https://www.neverenough.com/podcast), finding him on a handful of others podcasts like [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/), and sheleved his book: [Never Enough: From Barista to Billionaire](https://neverenough.co/).

If you ever listen to any of his public appearances or read his block, he has an open invite to grab a coffee. All you need to do is [fly out to Victoria](https://youtu.be/0T8bJuH60qU?si=DVW22pyse4z5_EBO&t=7625).

Luckily, I just needed to take a ferry instead of a plane 🛳

## Make plans without expectatiosn

Since Andrew's blog first came out, I replied to over half a dozen of his emails.

Even though my messages were sometimes witty, fun or insightful, busy people don't have time to get distracted by everyone's two cents, even if they're made of gold coins.

One day, I was a lot more deliberate and direct with my ask (I paraphrase): _"Can we meet if I get a ticket to Victoria?"_

After a couple of followups, lots of patience, and a bit of luck, his assistant jumped in. I got invited to Victoria's Enetrepneruship Lunch Club (ELC).

Though I was originally hoping for a 1:1 with Andrew (coffee, lunch or sauna session), I figured there would be a ton of interesting people at this event, and was equally pumped.

I planned out some logistics, grabbed the black friday deal from [clippervacations.com](https://www.clippervacations.com) for a roundtrip ferry, a two night stay, and decided I'd make a whole mini-vacation out of it. Best part: I had no plans other than that lunch.

I took the Ferry Thursday morning and arrived in Victoria at 11am. As I walked to my hotel, the vibe I got was like a Canadian version of Manchester.

At the hotel, I saw a flyer for [Butchart Gardens](butchartgardens.com/). Turns out it's one of Victoria's most iconic landmarks, and they were having a christmas special

I bought a ticket and had some time to kill. I started exploring the city and discover [Fan Tan Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley), the narrowest commercial street in North America that's only 3 feet wide.

I go to Butchart Gardens, and caught up with some friends over the phone as I was walking around the beautiful gardens, with mesmerizing colors, and some funny exhibitions.

The next morning, as I head down to the gym, I wake up to a text from my friend Austin, the founder at [Shinzo Labs](https://shinzolabs.com). I invited him to tag along for ELC, and he took me up on that last minute offer to crash at my hotel. I work out, he shows up, and we start making our way over to [Part and Parcel](https://www.partandparcel.ca).

Along the way, we discovered [Epic Games & More](https://epicgamesvic.com/). It was a fun and overhwleming blast of Nostaligia and childhood from video games to Pokemon cards. The world of cards and collectibles amazes me because it's the clearest textbook example of the power of branding, and the importance of human emotion in product design. Some Pokemon cards go for hundreds of dollars, and apparently Marvel vs Capcom 2 for Xbox is also a collectible, which I might actually have lying around somewhere.

When we show up at Part and Parcel, Austin and I joke that we didn't get the memo that you need need to be at least 6 feet to tall to be part of ELC 🙃.

We dive straight into a conversation with some of the other entpreneurs. Someone just moved to Victoria from Vancouver to expand their in-person fitness brand that's focused on mobility, longevity, and not posting things on instagram. As someone who used to go to the ER every year until the age of 18, followed by some "career ending" injures in my 20s, I loved it.

The official event kicks off and the first thing I hear is: **"Andrew won't be able to make it today."**

My heart sinks a bit... I made it all this way to meet him. But, the group there is so great that I decide to make the best of it.

Newcomers introduce themselves to the group, share a fun fact, and anyone at the event can share a win. One guy speaks up saying "my investment in SpaceX at $30B looks like it'll be alright" a day after the rumors came out that they're looking to IPO at $1.5T next year. _I paraphrase for some dramatic effect, but you get the point._

With about 30-40 people in total, we split into groups of 4-6, and there are two rules:

1. One conversation per table
2. Discuss the topic provided on the cards

I quickly realize that I'm surrounded by extremeley seasoned entrepeneurs. One person is bulding a company that has promising results to cure a form of cancer, another built a successful app for management of anxiety, adtech, identity tech, and so much more. Everyone but one individual has ADHD, we all (mostly) relate, but that conversation ran a tad too long IMO.

As we leave, I asked Rajeev, whom I was sitting next to, if he knew where/how I can reach Andrew. He added me to the ELC WhatsApp Group.

I figured the group will have names tied to the numbers, but alas, I was wrong. I try to Google the numbers of all the admins, but couldn't find anything pointing to Andrew.

I end up sending a "Hey Andrew" number to a couple of people, including one of the Admins, who ultimately directed me to the right person. I sent Andrew a message on WhatsApp and the patience game begins again.

As Austin and I head out, he mentions there's a chance Andrew will be at a comedy event that evening. I remember Andrew's last newsletter mentioning a local comedian who had a show that evening. As a lover of comedy, and an occassinoal improv practitioner, I was thinking of attending it either way. I get a ticket, and spend a few hours at a nearby Starbucks doing some work.

We go to the [Late Night Show with Nash Park](https://www.lamppostsocial.com/events/the-late-night-show-with-nash-park-72445). The show had it's moments (both good and bad), but I appreciated every skit and would recommend it to anyone visiting the city.

We didn't run into Andrew, but I'd call the day a success. We grab a late night slice of pizza and crash at the hotel for my last night.

The next day, I wake up, and as usual, head to the gym. As I'm jumping some rope, I get a response from Andrew! We set up a time to meet at a local coffee shop.

## Should I buy a company?

We meet up at [Hey Happy](https://www.heyhappycoffee.com/), and get straight into the conversation.

Since I know basically every Andrew has ever shared publically about himself via his book, blogs or poscasts, I got to share a bit about myself.

We dived into how Vyvanse is an open secret to "hapinness" for anyone with ADHD, alongside other parts of our supplement stack. At one point he took about a dozen pills out of his pocket and put them on the table. As someone who's been starting looking into Protein Powder, Creating and BCAA back in 2005, I thought: "This is my guy."

If you're an entrepenuer, you're likely a workaholic, which comes with having an addictive personality. This translates into other types of addictions in life, both good and bad. I wrote a bit more about this topic [here](./../thoughts/addicti)

By the end of our conversation, Andrew could tell I have ambitions to build impactful companies founded on deep-tech, but I don't have the financial freedom I need to do that effectively.

That's when he planted a seed: why not buy an existing company, cleanup the operations, cut the burn, and milk the cigar butt for everything that remains.

At first, I questioned how there could be a revenue generating company that needs this much help.

Companies require luck, and doing a true zero-to-one is non-trivial. Some people persevere their way into it, while others

There are plenty of founders who got lucky, are tired, and would be happy to let go for the price for someone to come in and cleanup their mess in exchange for some liquidity. Let's see if [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) on [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideproject/) comes up with anything.

There are also a lot of people in the older generation who might have built up a small business over years, or decades, and don't know what to do with. I don't think a reddit post would do, but I'm contemplating putting an ad in the paper :thinking_emoji:.

For the longest time, I've also thought of starting another company in the construction space, after [my first one (GetSoils)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getsoils/posts/?feedView=images&viewAsMember=true) didn't quite work out. Rather than selling AI tech to these companies, maybe buying them and automating internal processes E2E using AI-enabled tech is the play.

## Reflecting on something I should've said better

- I mentioned of not enjoying talking to investors
- In retrospect, I should have phrased it differently, and I reflected on why

There are two camps here:

- Never say no to money when people are willing to give it to you (with the right terms)
- Always have the conversation
- You need to raise early

My camp is:

- Have the conversation with smart and genuine people
- Say yes to money only if you need it
- If you're doing the right thing, you should be able to raise quickly from the right people that share your vision

I understand that an investor's sole goal is to create ROI, but personally, I only want to money from people who want to make money AND share my vision AND are cool enough that I'd always want to hang out with them: dinner, a walk, a sauna session?

In crypto, I feel like I've gotten burn by investors who only care about a quick ROI through pump and dumps. They create the illusion of caring about the product behind the scenes, but it's all smoke and mirrors.

_I'm not very experience on this front, so I'm sure I'm making quite a few mistakes here. I hope I'm not burning any bridges here..._

## Showing Up and Building Relationships

There's a well know proverb:

> "It's Not What You Know. It's Who You Know."

In my person opinion, it's not one or the other, but it's both. It's the only way to achieve anything great

There are two things I've changed my mind on over the past few years as I've been embarcking on my entrepreunrship journey:

1. Relationships rule the world
2. You can only build relationships in person

One thing I've changed my mind on over the past few years is the importance

## Making things happn

- Make a plan, have goals, but don’t have expectations and make the best out of any situation.
- One of my biggest learnings this year was “letting it go”. I would’ve been okay not seeing Andrew, but I’m very grateful we made the time for coffee
- Be flexible. Adapt. Make the best out of every situation. Build relationships.

## Travel Recommendations

This is just an aggregated list of the things I did and enjoyed in case you're planning a trip to Victoria yourself.

- **Comedy**: [Jump Comedy](https://www.jumpcomedy.com) and [Ok Dope](https://www.ok-dope.com/)
- **Nature**: [Butchart Gardens](https://butchartgardens.com/)
- **Tourism**: [Fan Tan Allye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley) in Chinatown
- **Nerdy**: [Epic Games & More](https://www.epicgamesvic.com/)
- **Food**: [Al Barak Medeternian](https://albarakvictoria.com/)

If you're travelling from Seattle, I recommend getting a pacakge from [FRS Clipper](https://www.clippervacations.com/) that'll have the ferry there and back, as well as put you in a good hotel. I stayed at the [Best Western Plus Carlton Plaza Hotel](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-victoria/best-western-plus-carlton-plaza-hotel/propertyCode.62063.html) and loved it. The location, service, room and gym were all great. Clipper also validates your parking at [Republic Parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e7ccWQeV7fi3ctx26) so you only pay $10/day.

If you're an entrepenruer, reach out to Andrew and his team at [Never Enough](https://www.neverenough.com/). You won't regret it.
