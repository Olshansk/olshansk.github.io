I've had a lot of conversations this past week with friends from various walks of life.

These conversations get deep, sometimes meta, and very introspective.

I challenge others, I get challenged myself, and on the other side of the conversation, a bit of clarity emerges.

This is not something I spent much time thinking about in my teens and early twenties. Over the last few years, though, I've spent a lot more time reflecting on it and have found a way to articulate it.

The mission is the goal, the motto is the means, and the life quest is the journey.

## My Mission

**Help every human achieve their full potential, starting with myself.**

Whether someone chooses to put in the effort to achieve their full potential is up to them. But no one should be limited from doing so.

I personally believe I have the potential to build a generational company, win a Nobel Prize, write an autobiography, and be a great son, brother, husband, and father.

I don't think I have the potential to become a world-class author, athlete, or filmmaker, and that's fine.

In the third leg of my life, once I have achieved my full potential, I want to help every human achieve their full potential.

I believe the key to this will be full control of the mind-body connection, which is where companies like Neuralink will come into play.

## My Motto

**Inspire my present self.**

I want my present self to inspire my past self, and my future self to inspire my present self.

Whether I'm listening to myself in an interview on a podcast or having dinner with myself at different points in life, I want to think: "I want to be that guy."

The motto is what drives my day-to-day actions.

Together, the mission and the motto are what get me up in the morning and lead to taking action.

## My Life Quest

**Bring the construction industry to the 21st century, starting with the geotechnical foundation.**

It's an ambitious goal, and everything I have done, and do today, is in service of this goal.

Whether it means building my IQ, skills, EQ, relationships, capital, or reputation, I'm doing it to finish this quest.

## My Current Main Quest

As of writing, my current major quest is to make sure the product at [Grove](https://grove.city) exists in this world.

Creators will always crave creating new content, but they need revenue.

Humans will always crave new experiences, but they need a way to connect.

Agents will always crave novel data, but they need a way to incentivize human creators to keep doing so.

Stablecoins and new web protocols are the mediums that enable this.

The micropayment platform we're building is the paradigm shift that ties it all together.
