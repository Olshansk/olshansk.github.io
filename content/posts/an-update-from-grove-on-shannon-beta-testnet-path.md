### An update from Grove on Shannon Beta TestNet, PATH, the Past & theÂ Future

ðŸ‘‹ If youâ€™re not ready to spend ~10 minutes reading, I suggest you bookmark this post and return to it later. *You wonâ€™t regret it. Itâ€™s more than an update; it dives into the problems [Pocket](https://www.pokt.network/) & [Grove](https://www.grove.city/) solve.

Youâ€™ll get a sense of where Shannon Beta TestNet is, but also get historical and technical context on why we need Pocket Network, what Groveâ€™s responsibility is in all of this, and what PATH is. If youâ€™ve ever had any of these questions, youâ€™ll get someâ€Šâ€”â€Šnot allâ€Šâ€”â€Šof the answers here.
