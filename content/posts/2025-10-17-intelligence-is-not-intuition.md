- It’s artificial. It’s general. It’s intelligent. It’s not intuitive. It’d be fun if openai released a rubber duck that sits on your desk.
- AGI is already here
- Superintelligence is not here
- I used LLMs in a general matter
- What these models have are tools, and they can be trained to use tools and have knowledge
- I don’t know if there’s a way to build intuition, because there’s no definitive reward function
- Time spent with them
- Experience in life
- 10,000 hours
- Augmented intelligence
- There’s no artificial intuition or trifocals intelligence
- Intelligence does not equal intuition
- There’s a reason it’s called training and inference, not learning and applying
