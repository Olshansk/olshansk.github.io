## My Ikigai (Center)

The intersection of all four:

> Building developer infrastructure and AI-augmented tools that unlock human potential, as a technical founder/leader.

## Open Questions

- Where do I have unfair advantages?
- What would I regret not trying?
- Is founder the only path, or is there another role that fits?
