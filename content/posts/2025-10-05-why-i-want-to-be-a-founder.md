- Look at notes
- Look at Rahul message
- I want to be CEO until we find PMF
- I want to have the history and context
- You need a decision maker
- Happy to surround myself with operators
- I’m an engineer, but not the type to whom@you give direction
- I don’t want to be told want to do, but I want to cooperate with someone on it
- I don’t just want to execute on technical plans
- I want to set strategic priorities
- I have ideas
- I have visions
- I want to see certain things happen in the world
- Been writing this for a little while
- A founder needs to wear a different hat every day, or every hour
- Similarly, I was finding a different reason every day as well
- Some days it’s needing to make a decision
- Other days it’s having freedom to follow@my curiosity
- Some days it’s the opportunity to build capital that’ll let me work on anything
- Some days its@to@inspire others
- Others it’s for@the journey
- Ultimately, it’s because I can’t see myself being fulfilled or happy on any other role
- There’s not just one reason to want to be a founder
- Mention a friend of mine asking me
- If the business isn't working (i.e. the equity is worthless), it was out of control. In this case, it's in my control to make the decisions to fix things.
