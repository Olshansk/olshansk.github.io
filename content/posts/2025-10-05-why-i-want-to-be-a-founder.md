- Look at notes
- Look at Rahul message
- I want to be CEO until we find PMF
- I want to have the history and context
- You need a decision maker
- Happy to surround myself with operators
- I’m an engineer, but not the type to whom@you give direction
- I don’t want to be told want to do, but I want to cooperate with someone on it
- I don’t just want to execute on technical plans
- I want to set strategic priorities
- I have ideas
- I have visions
- I want to see certain things happen in the world
