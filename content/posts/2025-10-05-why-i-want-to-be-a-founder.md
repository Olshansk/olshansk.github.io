- My goal is not a lifestyle, it’s a paradigm shift change
- I build conviction internally with external input
- Look at notes
- Look at Rahul message
- I want to be CEO until we find PMF
- I want to have the history and context
- You need a decision maker
- Happy to surround myself with operators
- I’m an engineer, but not the type to whom@you give direction
- I don’t want to be told want to do, but I want to cooperate with someone on it
- I don’t just want to execute on technical plans
- I want to set strategic priorities
- I have ideas
- I have visions
- I want to see certain things happen in the world
- Been writing this for a little while
- A founder needs to wear a different hat every day, or every hour
- Similarly, I was finding a different reason every day as well
- Some days it’s needing to make a decision
- Other days it’s having freedom to follow@my curiosity
- Some days it’s the opportunity to build capital that’ll let me work on anything
- Some days its@to@inspire others
- Others it’s for@the journey
- Ultimately, it’s because I can’t see myself being fulfilled or happy on any other role
- There’s not just one reason to want to be a founder
- Mention a friend of mine asking me
- If the business isn't working (i.e. the equity is worthless), it was out of control. In this case, it's in my control to make the decisions to fix things.
- Todo tch forward for construction
- Not tech for we’d enough for labs
- Feeling like a misfit
- Founder because I don’t quite belong in a community, so I need to create my own

- p until now, I’ve always acted as an owner of every job I’ve had to the point that it consumed my life and existence. Regardless of whether this is for better or for worse, it’s the case and I don’t think I have other modes of operation. Especially when I actually care about the the success of the company, business and its people. But, up until now, I’ve never actually been a real owner with the exception of GetSoils; Grove is a weird situation in between. If we do this, it’s not just a 3 year stint, but would likely (hopefully) be at least 10 years to really achieve significant impact, so it’s I’m taking this factor into consideration so heavily.

      I study company’s and founders, which inspire me. Very few people
      (karpathy, dean, etc). Have been able to do the same.

    <p>
      Push myself out of my@comfort zone to hone in on my weaknesses. Not
      operational, but emotional and risk taking.

  So why do I want to be a founder? Well, I have ideas. I want to set a certain
  direction a vision while again find some problems and then build a team around
  that vision and around the Russian, how we operate as we go and talk it.
  because I have my own preferences, of how to work. There's certain problems
  that I want to tackle, and I want to decide how we tackle them, and I don't
  think I would it takes to be a solo founder because there's a lots of gaps in
  my scalef sets, but I do want to be a co founder and get people very
  compimentary. Skill sets for it. You know, when I think about just coming very
  early, I realize that I need to work in a way where I can't say that a company
  can or cannot succeed without me, but where I at least, early on, they won't
  succeed without me, but eventually, they'll succeed differently whether or not
  I'm there once we pass a certain threshold or activation energy. So putting
  all of those together, I'm going to be joining someone really, really early. I
  need to be really, really aligned on the values and the culture and the
  operating structure. And I have to embody the direction and the vision and the
  excitment just as much as the founders. But if it's me and my early partners,
  then we'll go and get it together with very complementary skill sets. And
  putting all of those together, I really don't see a different direction right
  now.
