- Look at notes
- Look at Rahul message
- I want to be CEO until we find PMF
- I want to have the history and context
- You need a decision maker
- Happy to surround myself with operators
- I’m an engineer, but not the type to whom@you give direction
- I don’t want to be told want to do, but I want to cooperate with someone on it
- I don’t just want to execute on technical plans
- I want to set strategic priorities
- I have ideas
- I have visions
- I want to see certain things happen in the world
- Been writing this for a little while
- A founder needs to wear a different hat every day, or every hour
- Similarly, I was finding a different reason every day as well
- Some days it’s needing to make a decision
- Other days it’s having freedom to follow@my curiosity
- Some days it’s the opportunity to build capital that’ll let me work on anything
- Some days its@to@inspire others
- Others it’s for@the journey
- Ultimately, it’s because I can’t see myself being fulfilled or happy on any other role
- There’s not just one reason to want to be a founder
- Mention a friend of mine asking me
- If the business isn't working (i.e. the equity is worthless), it was out of control. In this case, it's in my control to make the decisions to fix things.
- Todo tch forward for construction
- Not tech for we’d enough for labs
- Feeling like a misfit
- Founder because I don’t quite belong in a community, so I need to create my own

- p until now, I’ve always acted as an owner of every job I’ve had to the point that it consumed my life and existence. Regardless of whether this is for better or for worse, it’s the case and I don’t think I have other modes of operation. Especially when I actually care about the the success of the company, business and its people. But, up until now, I’ve never actually been a real owner with the exception of GetSoils; Grove is a weird situation in between. If we do this, it’s not just a 3 year stint, but would likely (hopefully) be at least 10 years to really achieve significant impact, so it’s I’m taking this factor into consideration so heavily.
