It has barely been a day since ChatGPT launched, and I woke up to a timeline of different use cases that made it clear what the rest of this decade is going to look like:

Until auto-tagging **#ChatGPT** is an option, or someone writes a script that scrapes Twitter's firehose for GPT screenshots, here are just a few use cases I found today that blew my mind.

# Write react & tailwind

> ChatGPT by @OpenAI does really well with coding questions. Here I ask how to build a 3-column footer with Tailwind. I then follow-up and ask for a React version, more realistic copy, and mobile responsiveness. It nails it perfectly.

# Mermaid Diagrams

At work, we were writing some mermaid diagrams for our documentation. Even though this didn't quite solve the problem, it got us 80% of the way. The engineer only needs to take it over the finish line.

> Provide the source code for a top-down mermaid diagram of a complete binary tree with 8 leafs where each leaf is stylize using alternating colors.

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Root] --> B[Leaf 1]
A --> C[Leaf 2]
A --> D[Leaf 3]
A --> E[Leaf 4]
B --> F[Leaf 5]
B --> G[Leaf 6]
C --> H[Leaf 7]
C --> I[Leaf 8]

style F fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
style G fill:#333,stroke:#f9f,stroke-width:4px
style H fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
style I fill:#333,stroke:#f9f,stroke-width:4px
```

# Functional & Unit Tests

GitHub Copilot has become a close friend in the recent past, but what I'm most excited about is using ChatGPT to implement unit tests and design end-to-end functional tests.
