🔑 to being a software engineer in the 2020s: knowing how to GPT.[3:32 PM ∙ Dec 1, 2022](https://twitter.com/olshansky/status/1598339281785094144)Until auto-tagging **#ChatGPT** is an option, or someone writes a script that scrapes Twitter’s firehose for GPT screenshots, here are just a few use cases I found today that blew my mind.

## @OpenAI does really well with coding questions. Here I ask how to build a 3-column footer with Tailwind. I then follow-up and ask for a React version, more realistic copy, and mobile responsiveness. It nails it perfectly.

# Mermaid Diagrams

At work, we were writing some mermaid diagrams for our documentation. Even though this didn’t quite solve the problem, it got us 80% of the way. The engineer only needs to take it over the finish line.

> Provide the source code for a top-down mermaid diagram of a complete binary tree with 8 leafs where each leaf is stylize using alternating colors.

GitHub Copilot has become a close friend in the recent past, but what I’m most excited about is using ChatGPT to implement unit tests and design end-to-end functional tests.
