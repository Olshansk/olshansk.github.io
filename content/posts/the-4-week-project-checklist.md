A friend of mine recently asked me this question:

My immediate reaction was: *“How do I respond? People have literally written books about this.”* I asked him to clarify with a few more details so I could direct my response accordingly.

- This is a lot clearer and more actionable. Rather than adding to the noise and writing a whole book about it, as a Tim Feris fan, I figured I’d create **The 4-Week Project Checklist:**

**Length**: The architecture doc we’ll prepare should be **1-3 pages** and no more.

- **Purpose**: Write **1-2 sentences** describing the purpose of the project.

- **Goals**: Make a list of **5 bullet points** or less listing out the goals and/or deliverables.

- **Non-goals**: Make a list of **3 bullet points** or less explicitly listing out the non-goals and/or deliverables.

- **Block diagram**: Create a block diagram showing the different architectural components involved.

- **Sequence diagram**: Create a sequence diagram showing the end-to-end flow of the data/user/application/etc.

- **APIs**: List out any interfaces that are used or to be developed, with explicit documenting of key parameters involved.

- **Supporting text**: Add supporting text in paragraph form only if it cannot be described in the diagrams above.

- **References**: Include **1-3 external** references where the reader can learn more. Do not make this a link dump.
