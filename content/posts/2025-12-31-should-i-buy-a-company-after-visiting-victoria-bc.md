I took a ferry from Seattle to Victoria, and all I could think about on the way back was: **Which company should I buy (not build) to generate free cash flow?**

If you're a seasoned software engineer in the age of AI who lives to build, you're probably thinking how ridiculous this sounds.

Well, [Andrew Wilkinson](https://x.com/awilkinson) planted a [tiny](https://tiny.com/) seed in my mind, and it has started germinating.

Strap in. This post is about making plans without expectations, how that mindset extends into everything else in life, and if you're a Swiftie, I've got something special at the end as well.

## Discovering "Never Enough"

I first found out about Andrew on [episode 63 of the Acquirer's Podcast](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/04/ep-63-the-acquirers-podcast-andrew-wilkinson-berkshire-com-how-tiny-is-building-the-berkshire-of-the-internet/) back in the heat of the COVID lockdowns.

As a long-time value investor and student of Warren Buffett, the analogy I'd use is that Andrew is the **"Oracle of Victoria"** in Canada, and [Tiny.com](https://tiny.com/) is the Berkshire Hathaway of small internet businesses, spanning from coffee makers like [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/) to movie review sites like [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/).

As rotten as Rotten Tomatoes is, though, I'm too deeply invested in my profile there 🍅

![Rotten Tomatoes](/images/posts/should-i-buy-a-company-after-visiting-victoria/rotten_tomatoes.png)

Somewhere along the way between 2020 and now, I started reading [Andrew's blog](https://www.neverenough.com/newsletter), listening to [his podcast](https://www.neverenough.com/podcast), finding him on a handful of other podcasts like [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/), and shelving his book: [Never Enough: From Barista to Billionaire](https://neverenough.co/).

If you ever listen to any of his public appearances or read his blog, he has an open invite to grab a coffee. All you need to do is [fly out to Victoria](https://youtu.be/0T8bJuH60qU?si=DVW22pyse4z5_EBO&t=7625).

Luckily, I just needed to take a ferry instead of a plane 🛳

## Make plans without expectations

Since Andrew's blog first came out, I replied to over half a dozen of his emails.

Even though my messages were sometimes witty, fun, or insightful, busy people don't have time to get distracted by everyone's two cents, even when those cents are made of gold.

One day, I decided to be more deliberate and direct with my ask (paraphrased): _"Can we meet if I get a ticket to Victoria?"_

After a couple of follow-ups, a lot of patience, and a bit of luck, his assistant jumped in. I got invited to Victoria's Entrepreneurship Lunch Club (ELC).

Though I was originally hoping for a 1:1 with Andrew (coffee, lunch, or a sauna session), I figured there would be a ton of interesting people at the event and was equally pumped.

I planned out the logistics, grabbed a Black Friday deal from [clippervacations.com](https://www.clippervacations.com) for a round-trip ferry and a two-night stay, and decided to make a mini-vacation out of it. Best part: I had no plans other than that lunch.

I took the ferry Thursday morning and arrived in Victoria at 11am. As I walked to my hotel, the vibe felt like a Canadian version of Manchester.

At the hotel, I saw a flyer for [Butchart Gardens](https://butchartgardens.com/). Turns out it's one of Victoria's most iconic landmarks, and they were running a Christmas special.

I bought a ticket and had some time to kill. I explored the city and discovered [Fan Tan Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley), the narrowest commercial street in North America at just three feet wide.

I went to Butchart Gardens and caught up with some friends over the phone while walking through the grounds. The colors were mesmerizing, and the seasonal exhibits were unexpectedly funny.

The next morning, as I headed down to the gym, I woke up to a text from my friend Austin, the founder of [Shinzo Labs](https://shinzolabs.com). I had invited him to tag along for ELC, and he took me up on a last-minute offer to crash at my hotel. I worked out, he showed up, and we made our way to [Part and Parcel](https://www.partandparcel.ca).

Along the way, we stumbled into [Epic Games & More](https://epicgamesvic.com/). It was an overwhelming blast of nostalgia, from video games to Pokémon cards. The world of collectibles continues to amaze me. It's a textbook example of the power of branding and human emotion in product design. Some Pokémon cards go for hundreds of dollars, and apparently Marvel vs. Capcom 2 for Xbox is now a collectible, which I might actually have lying around somewhere.

When we arrived at Part and Parcel, Austin and I joked that we missed the memo that you need to be at least six feet tall to be part of ELC 🙃

We dove straight into conversations with other entrepreneurs. One person had just moved from Vancouver to expand an in-person fitness brand focused on mobility, longevity, and not posting on Instagram. As someone who used to go to the ER every year until age 18, followed by a few career-ending injuries in my 20s, I loved that.

The official event kicked off, and the first thing I heard was: **"Andrew won't be able to make it today."**

My heart sank a bit. I had come all this way to meet him. Still, the group was so good that I decided to make the most of it.

Newcomers introduced themselves, shared fun facts, and anyone could share a win. One guy mentioned that his SpaceX investment at a $30B valuation was looking pretty solid, a day after rumors surfaced about a potential $1.5T IPO. I paraphrase for effect, but you get the point.

With around 30 to 40 people total, we split into groups of four to six. There were two rules:

1. One conversation per table
2. Discuss the topic provided on the cards

I quickly realized I was surrounded by extremely seasoned entrepreneurs. One was building a company with promising results in curing a form of cancer. Another had built a successful anxiety management app. Others had backgrounds in adtech, identity tech, and more. Everyone but one person had ADHD. We all mostly related, though that conversation ran a bit long.

As we wrapped up, I asked Rajeev, who had been sitting next to me, if he knew how I could reach Andrew. He added me to the ELC WhatsApp group.

I assumed the group would show names tied to numbers. It didn't. I tried Googling admin numbers but came up empty. I ended up sending a "Hey Andrew" message to a few people, including an admin, who eventually pointed me in the right direction. I sent Andrew a WhatsApp message and resumed the patience game.

As Austin and I headed out, he mentioned that Andrew might be attending a comedy show that evening. I remembered Andrew mentioning a local comedian in his last newsletter who had a show that night. As a lover of comedy and occasional improv practitioner, I planned to attend regardless. I grabbed a ticket and spent a few hours working at a nearby Starbucks.

We went to the [Late Night Show with Nash Park](https://www.lamppostsocial.com/events/the-late-night-show-with-nash-park-72445). The show had its highs and lows, but I appreciated every skit and would recommend it to anyone visiting the city.

We didn't run into Andrew, but the day was still a success. We grabbed a late-night slice of pizza and crashed at the hotel for my last night.

The next day, I woke up and headed to the gym, as usual. While jumping rope, I got a response from Andrew. We set up a time to meet at a local coffee shop.

## Should I buy a company?

We met at [Hey Happy](https://www.heyhappycoffee.com/) and got straight into it.

Since I know just about everything Andrew has shared publicly through his book, blog, and podcasts, I got to share a bit about myself.

We talked about Vyvanse being an open secret for happiness among people with ADHD, along with other parts of our supplement stacks. At one point, he pulled about a dozen pills out of his pocket and set them on the table. As someone who has been looking into protein powder, creatine, and BCAAs since 2005, I thought: this is my guy.

If you're an entrepreneur, you're likely a workaholic, which often comes with an addictive personality. That tends to spill over into other addictions, both good and bad. I wrote more about this topic [here](./../thoughts/2025-12-23-addiction-adhd-discipline-and-obsession.md).

By the end of the conversation, Andrew could tell that I have ambitions to build impactful, deep-tech companies. He could also tell that I don't yet have the financial freedom to do that as effectively as I want.

That's when he planted the seed: why not buy an existing company, clean up the operations, cut the burn, and milk the cigar butt for everything that's left?

At first, I questioned how a revenue-generating company could need that much help.

Companies require founders with vision, grit, persistence, tolerance for pain, and adaptability. They require timing, real value creation, a true zero-to-one, and a sprinkle of luck.

Then it clicked. There are plenty of founders who had a good run in a particular niche at a particular time and would happily let go if the price, and a few other things, are right. There are also many people from older generations who built small businesses over decades and don't know what to do with them next.

For software companies, this is easier than ever today:

1. Review expenses and cut what you don't need
2. Move cloud workloads to bare metal
3. Automate with AI workflows
4. Scale the team down to the minimum

If you start with a product that generates revenue and provides value, the playbook is simple.

This is essentially what private equity does, but there's a real opportunity for a consulting shop that focuses on this without any ambition to scale the business itself.

## Showing Up, Building Relationships, Enjoying Every Moment and Making Things Happen

This trip worked out as well as it possibly could have, even though I had no real plan and accepted that my original goal might not happen.

It gave me space to reflect and be grateful. I had a rough plan, one simple goal, and no expectations.

One weakness I've adapted around over the past few years is learning to be more flexible, more adaptive, and better at letting things go.

I wasn't planning to explore Victoria, visit Butchart Gardens, go to a comedy show, or have anyone join me on this mini-adventure. I was planning to meet Andrew.

Up until the morning I was supposed to leave, expectations didn't match reality, but I enjoyed every moment anyway.

I kept asking, texting, and nudging things forward. Instead of a group lunch, I ended up with a one-on-one hour with Andrew. I got to know him beyond his public persona, which isn't all that different, and he got to know me.

I met a ton of interesting people along the way and couldn't have asked for more.

If you're one of the people I met on this trip and somehow made it this far, thank you.

## Reflecting on something I should've said better

You know that feeling when you say something in public and later realize it could have been framed better?

Yeah. That happened at ELC.

One of the discussion prompts was: **"What is something you want to do less of?"**

My pompous answer: **"Spend less time talking to investors."**

A great way to dig your own grave while sitting in a circle of present and future investors.

I should clarify.

I'll oversimplify by bucketing this into two camps:

1. Always be raising and never say no to money
2. Bootstrap a sustainable business and raise only when needed to scale

Both paths require constant relationship-building. Done with interesting, aligned people, it doesn't even feel like work.

Having spent years deep in crypto, though, I've had many conversations with people whose values didn't align with mine, and I've been burned.

I'm not interested in pump-and-dumps, quick flips, or zero-sum games that redistribute value instead of creating it.

I've had people want to invest without asking what the product is. I've had others ask if I could build something explicitly for a quick pump.

I move fast and care deeply about execution and revenue, but I believe investor returns should come after real value creation.

Hopefully I didn't burn any bridges.

## Victoria Travel Recommendations

A quick list for anyone looking to replicate the trip:

- **Comedy**: [Jump Comedy](https://www.jumpcomedy.com), [Ok Dope](https://www.ok-dope.com/)
- **Nature**: [Butchart Gardens](https://butchartgardens.com/)
- **Tourism**: [Fan Tan Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Tan_Alley)
- **Nerdy**: [Epic Games & More](https://www.epicgamesvic.com/)
- **Food**: [Al Barak Mediterranean](https://albarakvictoria.com/)

If you're traveling from Seattle, I recommend a package from [FRS Clipper](https://www.clippervacations.com/) that includes ferry transport and a hotel. I stayed at the [Best Western Plus Carlton Plaza Hotel](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-victoria/best-western-plus-carlton-plaza-hotel/propertyCode.62063.html) and loved it. Great location, service, room, and gym. Clipper also validates parking at [Republic Parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e7ccWQeV7fi3ctx26), which brings it down to $10 per day.

If you're an entrepreneur, reach out to Andrew and his team at [Never Enough](https://www.neverenough.com/). You won't regret it.
