### Explaining Fully Homomorphic Encryption to my¬†Mom

**_tl;dr_**

- **Traditional encryption** = Baking bread by reading & following the recipe
- **Homomorphic encryption** = Baking bread without ever seeing the recipe

### Traditional Encryption

- Mom writes her secret bread recipe
- She locks it (encrypts it)
- She sends it to me (no one can steal it along the way)
- **I unlock it (decrypt) and read it**
- I follow the instructions and bake bread
- I can share the unencrypted recipe with others
  Note that both my mom and I have a version of the key. We can both lock or unlock the recipe. Afterwards, I could theoretically share the recipe with my friends who could bake bread themselves; though whether I should is another story üôÉ.\*

### Homomorphic Encryption

- Mom writes her secret bread recipe
- She locks it (encrypts it)
- She sends it to me (no one can steal it along the way)
- **I do not unlock it**
- I **_magically_** follow the instructions and bake bread
- I can share the encrypted recipe with others
  Note that while my mom has a key she used to lock the recipe, I have a ‚Äúmagic key‚Äù_ that lets me follow the instructions without actually knowing what‚Äôs written inside. If I were to share the recipe with others, they‚Äôd need a version of the _‚Äúmagic key‚Äù as well.

### Reality Check

Of course, there‚Äôs no literal _‚Äúmagic key.‚Äù_ Instead, it‚Äôs a mountain of math and cryptography. I don‚Äôt fully understand the details, but I do know that it‚Äôs slow and expensive.

Right now, homomorphic encryption works for small, simple online tasks. It‚Äôll be a while before it‚Äôs fast and efficient enough to protect all of our online data.

And just for the record: I don‚Äôt actually bake bread. Here‚Äôs what usually happens instead‚Ä¶
