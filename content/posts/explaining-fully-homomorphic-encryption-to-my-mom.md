### Explaining Fully Homomorphic Encryption to my Mom

***tl;dr***

- ***Traditional encryption**** = Baking bread by reading & following the recipe
- ***Homomorphic encryption**** = Baking bread without ever seeing the recipe

### Traditional Encryption

- Mom writes her secret bread recipe
- She locks it (encrypts it)
- She sends it to me (no one can steal it along the way)
- **I unlock it (decrypt) and read it**
- I follow the instructions and bake bread
- I can share the unencrypted recipe with others
Note that both my mom and I have a version of the key. We can both lock or unlock the recipe. Afterwards, I could theoretically share the recipe with my friends who could bake bread themselves; though whether I should is another story 🙃.*

### Homomorphic Encryption

- Mom writes her secret bread recipe
- She locks it (encrypts it)
- She sends it to me (no one can steal it along the way)
- **I do not unlock it**
- I ***magically*** follow the instructions and bake bread
- I can share the encrypted recipe with others
Note that while my mom has a key she used to lock the recipe, I have a “magic key”* that lets me follow the instructions without actually knowing what’s written inside. If I were to share the recipe with others, they’d need a version of the *“magic key” as well.

### Reality Check

Of course, there’s no literal *“magic key.”* Instead, it’s a mountain of math and cryptography. I don’t fully understand the details, but I do know that it’s slow and expensive.

Right now, homomorphic encryption works for small, simple online tasks. It’ll be a while before it’s fast and efficient enough to protect all of our online data.

And just for the record: I don’t actually bake bread. Here’s what usually happens instead…
