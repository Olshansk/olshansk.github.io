One of a16z's recent post on [8 big ideas for 2026](https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/p/8-big-ideas-for-2026-and-more-trends?r=243uj&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) was on the topic **The invisible tax on the open web**.

They speak to the gap that lies between sustainble funding models for original online content by humans:

> AI agents extract data from ad-supported sites (the context layer), providing convenience to users while systematically bypassing the revenue streams (like ads and subscriptions) that fund the content. [...] This could include models like next-generation sponsored content, micro-attribution systems, or other novel funding models. Existing AI licensing deals are also proving to be a financially unsustainable Band-Aid, often compensating content providers with a fraction of the revenue they’ve already lost to AI-cannibalized traffic.

In Ilya Sutskever's 2024 NeurIPS talk, [he states that](https://youtu.be/WQQdd6qGxNs?si=VQmVNd1IP9JRR2JI&t=512) data, the fossil fuel of AI, is not growing!

![Fossil fuel of AI](/images/posts/why-tip/fossil_fuel_of_ai.png).

How do we bridge the gap between the tax on the internet, the fossil fuel of AI, and do it in a way that still creates a meaningful connection between humans and creators, while fostering an economic system between agents and human creators?

It uses AI, stablecoin crypto rails, and an incentive for all. This is a paradigm shift that creates a win-win-win scenario, we're alrady building it, and we're just scratching the surface.

## Why would humans tip humans?

## Why would agents tip humans?

## Rough Notes

### Rough Bullet Points

- Big numbers feel like an investment
- X402 and paywalls have their time and place
- Tipping feels good to get and feels good to give, without the pressure or the commitment . But you need an incentive
- Synthetic data is part of the pie, ground truth is another, original content is the third
- For https://grove.city/, you helped me frame something yesterday
- Incentive for humans to tip humans: every tip is a lottery ticket. You can connect with the creator. Grove can also, literally, make it a lottery. Every penny is an extra ballot.
- Incentive for agents to tip humans: derivate and synthetic data will never be enough. Ground truth is collected manually. Diverse original content needs an incentive, and the bet is that frontier labs will pay for it.
- Micro attributions. We’ll see what we call it
- Some people donate and support out of goodwill, but the dopamine rush of a leaderboard and winning something is bigger.
- Agents don’t need to be gamified as much, but they know they need original content t until the singularity hits.
- Tipping has a negative connotation. Micro supper, donation, attention? The key is that it’s optional and not a paywall, but there has to be an incentive. Generosity only goes so far.

### Random thoughts:

- There's a time and to have a paywall
- There's a time and place for content to be free
- We tip waiters, performers, drivers, etc. Whatever your perspective is on tipping, it's the fact that it is a social construct that's not going away, but will will be redefined in the AI era.
- Almost every platform out there (YouTube, Reddit, X, Twitch) has there own tipping platform, but there's isn't one that unnifes all of them. Imagine a venmo balance that you, or an agent, can use anywhere. Agents will get humans to create more content. Humans will have an opportunity to conntect with other humans. It's a win on every fornt
- Whether we call it micro-tipping, micro-attribution, micro-payments, or micro-support, what I'm sure of is that it's better than what you employer is paying for micro-soft.
