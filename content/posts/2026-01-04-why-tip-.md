One of a16z's recent posts,[8 big ideas for 2026](https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/p/8-big-ideas-for-2026-and-more-trends?r=243uj&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true), touched on a topic that stuck with me: **the invisible tax on the open web**.

The core idea is simple and uncomfortable.

> "AI agents extract data from ad-supported sites (the context layer), providing convenience to users while systematically bypassing the revenue streams (like ads and subscriptions) that fund the content.

And the only real path forward is a system that:

> "could include models like next-generation sponsored content, micro-attribution systems, or other novel funding models. Existing AI licensing deals are also proving to be a financially unsustainable Band-Aid, often compensating content providers with a fraction of the revenue they’ve already lost to AI-cannibalized traffic."

This reminded me of an observation Ilya Sutskever made in his 2024 NeurIPS talk. [He states that](https://youtu.be/WQQdd6qGxNs?si=VQmVNd1IP9JRR2JI&t=512) data, the fossil fuel of AI, is not growing!

Those two problems collide.

If original human content becomes economically irrational to produce, and AI systems depend on fresh, diverse, ground-truth data, the system eats itself.

So the question becomes: **How do we fund original content on the open web without rebuilding paywalls, killing distribution, or forcing creators into platform lock-in?**

And how do we do it in a way that works for both humans _and_ agents?

## A old but new primitive

Our answer is micro-tipping.

Not tipping as charity. Not tipping as guilt. Not tipping as a replacement for subscriptions, payments or paywalls.

Tipping as a lightweight, optional economic signal that creates alignment.

It uses AI, stablecoin payment rails, and incentives that work at human and machine scale. It does not require accounts, contracts, or commitments. And it works everywhere.

We are already building this at [Grove](https://grove.city). We are early, but the direction is clear.

## Why would humans tip humans?

There are two reasons:

1. It feels good
2. It's a lottery ticket to an experience

Tipping feels good when it is optional and low-stakes. The person sending the tip feels good, as does the person receiving it. If you micro-tip two cents at a time, you can feel good dozens of times a day.

Large payments feel like investments. Subscriptions feel like commitments. They come with expectations, pressure, deliberations, and second thoughts. Small payments feel expressive. They say “I liked this” without asking for anything in return.

Most importantly, this doubles by enabling a missing incentive platform that connects supporters to creators, irrespect of the platform they're on.

Every tip can double as a lottery ticket.

Leveraging stablecoin rails uses a public ledger. Grove, or anyone else, can build a platform or leaderboard where creators can connect with their audience.

If you make "A life in the day of" videos, you're tipping your way into a chance to spend a day in the life of the video creator. If it's an apparel maker, you're tipping your way into sweepstakes for that free pair of sneakers.

This is true interoperability. Anyone can see who tipped whom, what's at stake, who on, and it's platform independent.

A small chance at a meaningful upside, access, recognition, or connection changes behavior dramatically. One cent is no longer trivial if it is one more entry. Leaderboards work. Scarcity works. Humans are predictable this way.

**Generosity alone does not scale. Incentives do.**

## Why would agents tip humans?

Synthetic data is important, but it is not enough. Derivative content helps learning, but it has its limitations.

Ground truth still has to be produced manually, by humans, in the real world, with taste, context, and judgment. Frontier models already know this. They pay for data today through brittle licensing deals and private pipelines.

**Original free online human created content is not an OR, it's an AND.**

Micro-tipping turns this into an open market.

Agents do not need dopamine. They need access. They need freshness. They need diversity. Tipping becomes a clean, programmatic way to compensate creators for marginal value without negotiating contracts or enforcing paywalls.

**Until the singularity shows up, original human content remains a dependency.**

## This is not about paywalls

New protocols like [x402](https://www.x402.org/) have their place in the future of the web, but they're not an the endgame in themselves.

Paywalls have their place. Free content has its place. Micro-tipping lives in the middle.

It is optional. It does not block access. It does not fragment the web. It does not force creators to choose a platform.

Today, every major platform has reinvented tipping in isolation. YouTube, Twitch, X, Reddit. None of it composes.

What we are missing is a universal balance (a tipping jar) that humans and agents alike can use anywhere. Imagine a venmo-like primitive for the open web, for every social graph, with the same user experience wherever you go.

Call it micro-tipping.
Call it micro-attribution.
Call it micro-support.

The name matters less than the behavior. The important thing is that we're not paying micro-soft.

Tipping already exists as a social construct. We tip drivers, performers, waiters. Whatever your opinion of tipping culture, it is not going away. It is being redefined in the AI era.

The open web needs a native way to say “this mattered” without closing itself off.

That is the story we are telling. And we think it unlocks a win for creators, users, agents, and the internet itself.

They speak to the gap that lies between sustainble funding models for original online content by humans:

> AI agents extract data from ad-supported sites (the context layer), providing convenience to users while systematically bypassing the revenue streams (like ads and subscriptions) that fund the content. [...] This could include models like next-generation sponsored content, micro-attribution systems, or other novel funding models. Existing AI licensing deals are also proving to be a financially unsustainable Band-Aid, often compensating content providers with a fraction of the revenue they’ve already lost to AI-cannibalized traffic.

In Ilya Sutskever's 2024 NeurIPS talk,

![Fossil fuel of AI](/images/posts/why-tip/fossil_fuel_of_ai.png).

How do we bridge the gap between the tax on the internet, the fossil fuel of AI, and do it in a way that still creates a meaningful connection between humans and creators, while fostering an economic system between agents and human creators?

It uses AI, stablecoin crypto rails, and an incentive for all. This is a paradigm shift that creates a win-win-win scenario, we're already building it, and we're just scratching the surface.

## Why would humans tip humans?

## Why would agents tip humans?

## Rough Notes

### Rough Bullet Points

- Big numbers feel like an investment
- X402 and paywalls have their time and place
- Tipping feels good to get and feels good to give, without the pressure or the commitment . But you need an incentive
- Synthetic data is part of the pie, ground truth is another, original content is the third
- For https://grove.city/, you helped me frame something yesterday
- Incentive for humans to tip humans: every tip is a lottery ticket. You can connect with the creator. Grove can also, literally, make it a lottery. Every penny is an extra ballot.
- Incentive for agents to tip humans: derivate and synthetic data will never be enough. Ground truth is collected manually. Diverse original content needs an incentive, and the bet is that frontier labs will pay for it.
- Micro attributions. We’ll see what we call it
- Some people donate and support out of goodwill, but the dopamine rush of a leaderboard and winning something is bigger.
- Agents don’t need to be gamified as much, but they know they need original content t until the singularity hits.
- Tipping has a negative connotation. Micro supper, donation, attention? The key is that it’s optional and not a paywall, but there has to be an incentive. Generosity only goes so far.

### Random thoughts:

- There's a time and to have a paywall
- There's a time and place for content to be free
- We tip waiters, performers, drivers, etc. Whatever your perspective is on tipping, it's the fact that it is a social construct that's not going away, but will will be redefined in the AI era.
- Almost every platform out there (YouTube, Reddit, X, Twitch) has there own tipping platform, but there's isn't one that unnifes all of them. Imagine a venmo balance that you, or an agent, can use anywhere. Agents will get humans to create more content. Humans will have an opportunity to conntect with other humans. It's a win on every fornt
- Whether we call it micro-tipping, micro-attribution, micro-payments, or micro-support, what I'm sure of is that it's better than what you employer is paying for micro-soft.
