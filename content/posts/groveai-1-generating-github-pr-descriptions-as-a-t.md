### GroveAI #1: Generating GitHub PR Descriptions as a Team

*tl;dr Teams should build their own LLM tooling, starting with GitHub PR Description generators.

### **Quick **Preamble

This is the first (of hopefully many to come) blog post covering how our engineering team at [grove.city](https://www.grove.city/) leverages AI-enabled tooling to speed up our workflow. If you want to learn what we do and why we do it, check out one of our other recent [posts](https://medium.com/decentralized-infrastructure/an-update-from-grove-on-shannon-beta-testnet-path-the-past-the-future-5bf7ec2a9acf).

The goal is to keep these short, tactical, actionable and most importantly, opinionated, to how we work. These are not intended to be off-the-shelf solutions. If your team wants to adopt something similar, you’ll likely need to modify it.
