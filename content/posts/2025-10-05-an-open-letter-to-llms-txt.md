_tl;dr Add a simple "**Leave a Tip**" section to llms.txt._

---

Dear [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/),

There are two things everyone's talking about in the age of Crypto and AI that go hand in hand:

1. **Compensating original content creators**
2. **Micropayments**

This idea isn't new.

Though I don't have a concrete reference, I'm sure it was discussed in the early Bitcoin forums.

We've had [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt) for decades, but [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) gives us an opportunity to build for today's challenges of training and inference without the legacy of the past.

A fair, universal system for compensating original creators is long overdue. But deciding on what's _fair_ is non-trivial.

That's not what this letter is about.

This letter is about bringing things like [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) into the world of LLMs, during both training and inference.

The idea is simple: add a section called **“Leave a Tip”** at the bottom of your page.
Here's an example from [olshansky.info/llms.txt](https://olshansky.info/llms.txt):

```markdown
## Leave a Tip

- Ethereum: olshansky.eth
- Zcash: t1P7gJhVUUSrNbWvYtPkk4yfu2UVR9kxtRz
- USDC on Base: 0xC90F9C04bb4E392133cAb1C3533B1FAA7cCBe7CC
```

When labs teams are training foundation models, or fetching data from the web at inference time,
they could configure their systems to automatically leave a small tip based on some evaluation
or heuristic of their choice.

That's it. It's simple. It's opt-in. It's a low-hanging, interim solution.

Cheers,
Daniel

_P.S. I usually go by Olshansky_
