_tl;dr Please add "**leave a tip**" to llms.txt._

Dear [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/),

There are two things everyone is talking about in the age of Crypto & AI that go hand in hand:

1. **Compensating original content creators**
2. **Micropayments**

This idea is not new.

Though I don't have a concrete reference, I'm sure this idea was discussed on Bitcoin forums early on.

We've have [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt) for years, but [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/)
is where we have an opportunity to do things anew in the context of training and inference.

A proper system for compensating original content creators is long overdue, but deciding on something "fair" is non-trivial.

That's not what this letter is about.

This letter is above bringing things like [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) to the world of LLMs; both in the context of training and inference.

The idea is simple, add a section called **"Leave a Tip"** at the bottom of the page. Similar to how I did in [olshansky.info/llms.txt](https://olshansky.info/llms.txt):

```markdown
## Leave a Tip

- Ethereum: olshansky.eth
- Zcash: t1P7gJhVUUSrNbWvYtPkk4yfu2UVR9kxtRz
- USDC on base: 0xC90F9C04bb4E392133cAb1C3533B1FAA7cCBe7CC
```

When labs teams are training their models or searching the web at inference time,
they can configure their infrastructure to leave a tip based on some evaluation
or heuristic of their choice.

**That's it. It's simple. It's opt-in. It's a low-hanging interim solution.**

Cheers,
Daniel

_P.S. I usually go Olshansky_
