# Introduction

tl;dr The Silent Pause is inspired by The Silent Manifesto and is primarily targeted at slow-thinkers.

One of my favorite posts from the past decade is The Silent Manifesto.

TODO: Add a link to the Silent Manifesto above.

It’s a methodology I apply on a regular basis, either in part or in full. Usually, it’s related to meetings at work. Occasionally, I apply its principles independently—when reflecting on something I’ve read or reviewing something I’ve written. It’s one of very few process-oriented blog posts I recommend to someone at least a couple of times a year.

In this post, I want to share The Silent Pause. It’s inspired by The Silent Manifesto, and in many ways, a mirror of how I think. As a byproduct, it’s also part of the culture that trickles down the engineering culture at Grove.

If you’re a fan of The Silent Manifesto, and consider yourself to be a slow thinker, I think you’ll appreciate this. It requires some comfort with discomfort, a minimal dose of situational awareness, a tad of authority, and a lot of frustration with unproductive meetings.

# The Silent Manifesto

tl;dr The Silent Manifesto is how most meetings should be run. It puts guardrails in place and acts as a forcing function to prevent people from falling into easier, more comfortable, and less output-oriented meetings.

On the off-chance you’re in the unique bucket of people who reads my blog but hasn’t heard of one of Jeff Bezos’ infamous meeting methodologies, here’s the quick version.

The Silent Manifesto makes writing, reading, and thinking part of the process before we start discussing. In particular:

Preparation – The organizer writes a 2–5 page document outlining: purpose, background/context, desirable outcomes, and key decisions/questions.

Silent Reading – Everyone spends the first 15–30 minutes reading in silence, making notes, and leaving comments.

Discussion – The second half of the meeting is a live discussion, resolving complex comments and making decisions on open questions.

TODO: Revisit the original Silent Manifesto and refine these bullets.

The Meeting Loop of Doom

If you follow the Silent Manifesto and have an experienced leader, meetings usually turn out okay.

But when meetings go off track—spiraling, going in circles, and ending with “hard stop, let’s schedule a follow-up”—you’ve entered what I call the meeting loop of doom.

Here’s an example from work:

Meeting lead: “We should use either [tool #1] or [tool #2] for this part of the migration.”

Me: “Do you know why the previous team used [tool #3] here?”

Lead: “Not 100% sure, maybe because…”

Attendee #1: “I think it was because…”

Attendee #2: “Yes, but maybe also because…”

Lead: “Interesting, maybe they were trying to…”

Me: “All interesting, but do we have any concrete evidence why this decision was made? Any references?”

Everyone fills the air with inconclusive hypotheticals.

Classic loop of doom.

The Silent Pause – Team Meeting

Here’s what I did:

Me:

“Okay, here’s what we’re going to do.

Let’s all take a 5-minute break.

Then, in silence, we’ll spend 10 minutes researching for a link, reference, or evidence for why this tradeoff was made. Or use the time to understand the tool itself.

If we don’t find anything, we’ll just accept ‘it worked’ and move on.”

Doing something like this comes with a few luxuries:

We don’t schedule many meetings, so I knew people were available after the fact.

Leadership alone isn’t enough to reset a meeting—you need a bit of authority.

It’s rare. Used sparingly, it strengthens team culture. Overused, it kills it.

The Silent Pause – Question on Priorities

One of my personal pitfalls is prioritization on the spot.

I like to gather notes, organize them, reflect, and go on a walk. The right answer usually hits me the next morning during my workout.

But often, I don’t have 24 hours—I have to make a decision now.

Example:

Ongoing discussion around tasks, blockers, priorities.

Colleague: “Should we do X or Y first?”

Me: “Hmm… Give me 45–60 seconds.”

Silence in the room.

Me: (thinking through downstream dependencies, unknowns, customer needs…)

Me: “Let’s do X first, revisit Y next week.”

That silent 60 seconds? It often feels awkward. But if it saves hours or days of wasted effort, it’s more than worth it.

Concluding Thoughts

Take this with a grain of salt—I hate scheduled meetings and I work in a technical domain.

Adhoc meetings are great. Well-prepared meetings with clear agendas are great. Cutting meetings short is great.

But I’ve got scars from those “11:30 to 12:00” filler meetings. How do those even exist?

A Bit of Self-Reflection

They say your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness. For me, that’s slow thinking.

The Silent Pause is my antidote to that—my way of accounting for it instead of fighting it.

My current solutions:

Improv – A fun hobby to practice thinking on the spot.

Panels – I don’t love them, but they’re improv in a professional wrapper.

The Silent Pause – A methodology (not a crutch) to accommodate slow thinking.

Preparation – Outlines, notes, reviews. Always prepare.

Culture trickles down, and leadership sets the tone. A healthy org creates space for both top-down and bottom-up ideas. The Silent Pause is one of mine.

Special Thanks

This post was inspired by @Wes’ writing. Many of the tools in my leadership toolbox come from her blog. Hopefully this one adds something useful to yours.
