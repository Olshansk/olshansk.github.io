Last week I attended an invitation-only Open House at Amazon’s headquarters. It was an exclusive eye-opener into how the company actually thinks about its engineering culture at scale.

I didn't know what to expect—but who would say no to a nice dinner with smart people and insightful conversations in [Seattle's Spheres](https://www.seattlespheres.com)? This is my version of a great night out. [1]

I was pleasantly surprised. It was a firsthand look into the senior engineering culture Jeff Bezos catalyzed—one that continues to be embodied by those leading the company today.

Three key takeaways stood out:

1. **Purpose**: Mission Driven Work
2. **Structure**: The clear alignment between titles and roles
3. **Focus**: Craft over perks

Amazon didn’t ask me to write this. I just wanted to capture my thoughts while they’re fresh. If you’ve ever been curious about what their culture feels like from a third-party perspective, this might help.

## Purpose: Mission Driven Work

**The space industry is the definition of a mission-driven culture**.

[MiMi Aung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiMi_Aung), a 30-year NASA veteran and Director of Technical Program Management for [Project Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper), gave a presentation I’ll never forget.

She oversaw the development of [Ingenuity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)>), the tiny helicopter that flew on Mars.

She’s one of the most mission-driven people I’ve ever met. You could tell she had hundreds of stories to share but only 15 minutes to do it. The world is lucky to have people like her. **A three-hour podcast (Lex? Tim? Any takers?) is what we need but don’t yet have.**

In one circle, I spoke with a Director from Blue Origin, an engineer from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a Principal SDE from Project Kuiper—and I could tell I was among people building the future.

Best of all, I'm grateful to live in a time where the private sector, and companies like Amazon, are both able and willing to provide the resources to ensure execution isn’t limited in the short term, while remaining pragmatic enough to demand financial returns in the mid to long term.

This reinforced some ideas I’ve been mulling over. After this event, I can’t let them go. More on that in another post. [2]

## **Structure**: The clear alignment between titles and roles

**A Senior Principal Engineer is not a Director is not a Vice President.**

At a small startup, a CTO might wear many hats—CTO, VP, Director, Principal SDE, Test Engineer, or even salesperson—depending on the time of day.

At a company like Amazon, though that overlap exists occasionally, it’s not the norm.

There was a panel with three Senior Principals and one Director. Some had been at Amazon for over 20 years; others for just a few. In both cases, the clarity of their roles was striking.

**A Senior Principal Engineer** is responsible for figuring out what to do and making it happen. Sometimes they do it themselves; sometimes they teach or enable others.

**A Director** ensures those engineers can do their jobs—securing resources, scheduling meetings, and removing obstacles. _“I got you.”_

**A Vice President** prioritizes direction and makes one-way decisions. They gather information from their teams, but critical decisions aren’t made by committee—they’re made by individuals.

I find one-way doors fascinating. They require a mix of experience, intuition, optimism, risk tolerance, and authority. I asked for examples after the presentation, and their answers expanded my perspective.

From my own startup experience (albeit on a much smaller scale), one-way decisions have included irreversible team changes, choosing frameworks that define ecosystem alignment, and setting immovable timelines.

When I asked a VP at Amazon for examples, they gave me bigger ones:

- **Leadership hires** – A bad hire can poison a culture in ways that are hard to undo.
- **Product selection** – Shutting down a product can disband entire organizations.
- **Letting go of a customer** – Once you deprioritize a customer, that trust may never return.

## **Focus**: Craft over perks

**Amazon remains deeply focused on customer and craft—without the frills.**

Amazon’s founding team built the culture—but it outlives those who set it in motion. There’s power and beauty in witnessing that firsthand.

On my drive home, I reflected on what was said—and just as importantly, what wasn’t.
No talk of lunches, gyms, benefits, or flexible hours. The word _balance_ didn’t come up once.

There was only talk of customer obsession. Of solving problems at scale—imagining the biggest problem possible and multiplying it by ten. Of being surrounded by hardworking, intelligent, and honest peers doing their best work.

I asked questions, cracked jokes, and raised my hand often. Every Amazonian there truly embodied the company’s values. It’s why some have spent their entire careers there, and why others have left and later returned.

## The Open House Event

The organizers deserve credit—the event was meticulously planned.

It struck the perfect balance of talks, panels, Q&A, and breaks. We’ve all been in events so packed they lead to exhaustion; this wasn’t one of them.

The guest-to-Amazonian ratio was just right. I’d estimate around 35 attendees and 15 Amazonians total. It felt intimate enough to meet everyone, yet lively enough to feel energetic.

I learned what it was like to work at Amazon in 2000, what onboarding feels like in 2025, and I spoke to engineering leaders spanning industries from space to biotech.

## So What Do I Think?

Mostly, I’m just grateful—for the people I met, the conversations I had, and the ideas I left with.

I’m on my entrepreneurial journey, and I’d love to create the same kind of Principal Engineering community Amazon has.

If you’re a Principal+ Software Engineer, I highly recommend reaching out to their recruiting team. No frills, no fluff, no games—just a chance to chat with some of the smartest people in the industry.

**For all Amazon’s scale, their success still rests on something primitive: curiosity, clarity, and execution. Everything else—AI, perks, org charts—is scaffolding.**

[1] I like to call the Amazon Spheres “Bezos’ Balls.” To build a company as big as Amazon, you need some big ones—and two isn’t enough. 🙃
[2] As a software-first individual, I test and leverage AI tools every day. I’ve used GitHub Copilot since 2021 and can’t imagine working without ChatGPT or Claude. I asked people across Amazon, NASA, and Blue Origin about their AI experiences. For some reason, those at the “real engineering” level are slow to adopt these tools. The opportunity here is massive—it’s only a matter of time. I’ll save the details for another post, but now I have a goal: to deserve a spot at the [MARS Conference](https://marsconference.com/).
