Last week, Amazon quietly hosted a private open house for senior engineering leaders at their Seattle headquarters. About fifty people gathered to discuss how Amazon makes technical decisions at scale, the kind you don‚Äôt hear about in press releases or leadership books.

I didn't know what to expect, but who would say no to a nice dinner with smart people and insightful conversations in the [Seattle Spheres](https://www.seattlespheres.com/)? This is my version of a great night out. [1]

It was a firsthand look into the senior engineering culture that Jeff Bezos started and that continues to define the company today.

Three key themes stood out:

1. **Purpose:** Mission-driven work
2. **Structure:** Clear alignment between titles and roles
3. **Focus:** Craft over perks

Amazon didn‚Äôt ask me to write this. I simply wanted to capture my thoughts while they‚Äôre fresh. If you‚Äôve ever wondered what Amazon‚Äôs engineering culture feels like from the inside, this might help.

## Purpose: Mission-Driven Work

**The space industry is the definition of mission-driven culture.**

[MiMi Aung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiMi_Aung), a NASA veteran of 30 years and Director of Technical Program Management for [Project Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper), delivered a presentation I‚Äôll never forget.

She oversaw the development of [Ingenuity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)>), the small helicopter that flew on Mars.

She‚Äôs one of the most mission-driven people I‚Äôve ever met. You could tell she had hundreds of stories to share but only fifteen minutes to tell them. The world is lucky to have people like her. **A three-hour podcast (Lex? Tim? Any takers?) is what we need but don‚Äôt yet have.**

In one circle, I spoke with a Director from Blue Origin, an engineer from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a Principal SDE from Project Kuiper. It was clear I was among people building the future.

It‚Äôs inspiring to live in a time when the private sector, and companies like Amazon, are both willing and able to provide resources so that execution isn‚Äôt limited in the short term, while remaining pragmatic enough to demand financial returns in the medium and long term.

This reinforced a few ideas I‚Äôve been mulling over. After this event, I can‚Äôt let them go. More on that in another post. [2]

## Structure: Clear Alignment Between Titles and Roles

**A Senior Principal Engineer is not a Director and not a Vice President.**

At a small startup, a CTO might wear many hats: CTO, VP, Director, Principal SDE, Test Engineer, or even salesperson, depending on the time of the day.

At a company like Amazon, while that overlap exists occasionally, it isn‚Äôt the norm.

There was a panel with three Senior Principals and one Director. Some had been at Amazon for more than twenty years; others for only a few. In both cases, the clarity of their roles was striking.

**A Senior Principal Engineer** is responsible for figuring out what to do and making it happen. Sometimes they do it themselves; sometimes they guide or enable others.

**A Director** ensures those engineers can do their jobs by securing resources, arranging meetings, and removing obstacles. _‚ÄúI got you,‚Äù_ as one said.

**A Vice President** prioritizes direction and makes one-way decisions. They gather input from their teams, but critical calls aren‚Äôt made by committee. They are made by individuals.

The topic of one-way doors fascinated me. They require a mix of experience, intuition, optimism, risk tolerance, and authority. I asked for examples after the presentation, and their answers expanded my perspective.

From my own startup experience, on a much smaller scale, one-way decisions have included irreversible team changes, choosing frameworks that define ecosystem alignment, and setting immovable timelines.

When I asked a VP at Amazon for examples, they shared far-reaching ones:

- **Leadership hires** ‚Äì A bad hire can poison a culture in ways that are hard to undo.
- **Product selection** ‚Äì Shutting down a product can disband entire organizations.
- **Letting go of a customer** ‚Äì Once you deprioritize a customer, that trust may never return.

My takeaway from that conversation:

> One-way doors require top-down decisions. Reversible decisions should come from bottom-up ownership.

Amazon‚Äôs rule of thumb: reversible decisions move fast; one-way doors move slow.

## Focus: Craft Over Perks

**Amazon remains deeply focused on customers and craft, without the frills.**

Amazon‚Äôs founding team built the culture, but it has outlived those who set it in motion. There is power and beauty in seeing that firsthand.

On my drive home, I reflected on what was said, and just as importantly, what wasn‚Äôt. There was no talk of lunches, gyms, benefits, or flexible hours. The word _balance_ never came up.

There was only talk of customer obsession, of solving problems at scale‚Äîimagining the biggest problem possible and multiplying it by ten. Of being surrounded by hardworking, intelligent, and honest peers doing their best work.

I pressed with a few questions during the panel. Every Amazonian there truly embodied the company‚Äôs values. It‚Äôs why some have spent their entire careers there, and why others have left and later returned.

At Amazon, customer obsession isn‚Äôt just a value; it‚Äôs a constraint on every technical tradeoff.

## The Open House Event

The organizers deserve credit. The event was meticulously planned.

It struck the right balance of talks, panels, Q&A, and breaks. We‚Äôve all been in events so packed they lead to exhaustion. This one didn‚Äôt.

The guest-to-Amazonian ratio felt perfect. I‚Äôd estimate around thirty-five attendees and fifteen Amazonians. It was intimate enough to meet everyone, yet lively enough to feel energetic.

I learned what it was like to work at Amazon in 2000, what onboarding feels like in 2025, and spoke with engineering leaders spanning industries from space to biotech.

## So What Do I Think?

Mostly, I‚Äôm just grateful for the people I met, the conversations I had, and the ideas I left with.

I‚Äôm on my entrepreneurial journey, and I‚Äôd love to create the same kind of Principal Engineering community that Amazon has.

If you‚Äôre a Principal+ Software Engineer, I highly recommend reaching out to their recruiting team. No frills, no fluff, no games‚Äîjust a chance to speak with some of the smartest people in the industry.

**For all Amazon‚Äôs scale, its success still rests on three primitives: curiosity, clarity, and execution. Everything else‚ÄîAI, perks, org charts‚Äîis scaffolding.**

Culture endures when decisions, not slogans, carry it forward.

_Written after attending Amazon‚Äôs 2025 October Engineering Open House in Seattle._

[1] I like to call the Amazon Spheres ‚ÄúBezos‚Äô Balls.‚Äù To build a company as big as Amazon, you need some big ones, and two isn‚Äôt enough. üôÉ
[2] As a software-first individual, I test and use AI tools every day. I‚Äôve used GitHub Copilot since 2021 and can‚Äôt imagine working without ChatGPT or Claude. I asked people across Amazon, NASA, and Blue Origin about their AI experiences. For some reason, those at the ‚Äúreal engineering‚Äù level are slow to adopt these tools. The opportunity here is massive, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time. I‚Äôll save the details for another post, but now I have a goal: to earn a spot at the [MARS Conference](https://marsconference.com/).
