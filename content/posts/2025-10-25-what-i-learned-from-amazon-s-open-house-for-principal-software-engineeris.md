Amazon Open House thoughts

We hear about culture

- decision by commity doesnâ€™t work
- One individual takes th burden

Mars conference by Jeff Bezos

- Private sector pushing the state of the art

Research project kuiper

One way doors

- leadership hire
- Culture dissipates
- Losing a customer
- Lose trust

Idea

- agents need the equivalent of an uptime SLA but with likelihood of achieving a goal
- Toolbox explosion for agents

Learning

Fun fac

- game function is factorial for Me too.
-
- I realized there was no talk about gyms, benefits, food or anything along those lines.
-
- It was just this is how we operate and what we value.
-
- We got a bunch of smart, honest people with integrity and agency.
-
- If rhats what you value - come work here.

Putting mentorship and leadership aside, from an execution perspective:
SDE: figure out what to do, do it, and lead/morivatethe Lowe levels engineers to do it
Directors: enable SPE: meeting, resource,
Awareness.
VPs: make one way decisions after collection information

Project kapier is full of missionaries

I did not hear the word benefits
I did not hear work life balance
These are people who are solving some of the worlds hardest engineering challenges
The machine gives them the platform and resources to do so
