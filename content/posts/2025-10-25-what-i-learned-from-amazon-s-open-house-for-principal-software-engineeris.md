I was recently invited to Amazon's Open House for Engineering Leaders.

I didn't know what to expect, but who would say no to a nice dinner, with smart people, and insightful conversations in the [Seattle's Spheres](https://www.seattlespheres.com)? I guess some would, but this is my equivalent of a "great night out". [1]

_TODO: Insert a photo of the spheres_

I was very pleasantly surprised. It was a firsthand view into the senior engineering culture that Jeff Bezos catalyzed, and has been embodied by those who lead the company today.

The three key takeaways and highlights like so:

1. The space industry is the definition of mission driven culture
2. A Senior Principal Engineer is not a Director is not a Vice President
3. Amazon truly is focused on customer and craft without the frills

Amazon did not ask me to write this. I just wanted to capture my thought of the experience while its fresh in my mind. If you were ever curious what their culture is like from a 3rd party perspective, this post might help.

## Missionary Space Culture

[MiMi Aung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiMi_Aung), a 30 year Nasa veteran and the direct of technical program management [Project Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper) delivered a presentation I'm never going to forget.

She oversaw the development of the [Ingenuity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)>), which if you're not in space, is that tiny helicopter that flew on Mars.

She is one of the most mission driven people I've ever met. You could tell she had hundreds of stories to share, but only 15 minutes to share them. The world is lucky to have people like her. **A 3 hour podcast (Lex? Tim? Any takers?) is what we need but do not have.**

I was talking to a director from Blue Origin, an engineer from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a principal SDE from Project Kuiper, and could tell I'm in the presence of people building the future.

Best of all, I love that the private sector, with companies like Amazon, are able to and willing to provide the resources execution is not limited in the short-term, and are pragmatic enough to understand that it has to deliver a financial return in the mid and long term.

This also reinforced some ideas I've had recently, but after this event, I can't let them go. More on that in another post. [2]

## A Senior Principal Engineer is not a Director is not a Vice President

At a small startup, a CTO needs to be, depending on the time of the day, either a CTO, Vice President, Director, Principal SDE, Test Engineer or sales person.

At a company like Amazon, though this can be true on occasion, it's not the norm.

There was a panel with 3 Senior Principals, and one Director. Some people have been working at Amazon for 20+ years, while others have only been there for a few. In both cases, the organic clarity of the roles was very apparent.

**A Senior Principal Engineer** is responsible for figuring out what to do, and _make it happen_. In some cases they do it, in some, they teach or help others do it.

**A Director** is responsible for enabling the Principal SDE to do their job. You need a resource to do something? You need a meeting with someone? _I got you._

**A Vice President** is responsible for prioritizing the direction, and is responsible for making one way decisions. Leverage your team to collect information, but critical decision making is not by comity, its done by an individual.

I find one way doors very interesting. It requires a mix of experience, intuition, optimism, risk tolerance, and authority. I had to go up and ask for some examples after the presentation.

From my own experience, at a very small startup thats inconsequential relative to Amazon, one way decisions I've had to make include irreversible team recompositions, framework selection in the context of ecosystem alignment, and setting non-movable timelines.

When I asked a VP at Amazon for examples, they opened up my mind to much more:

- **Leadership Hires** - A bad hire can poison the culture in a way that is hard to undo.
- **Product Selection** - Shutting down a product or project can lead to multiple organizations being disbanded.
- **Letting go of a customer** - If you choose to deprioritize a customer for some reason, that trust is lost, and may never be regained.

## Amazon truly is focused on customer and craft without the frills

**Amazon's founding team member built the culture, but it outlives those who set it in motion.** There is so much power and beauty in seeing this first hand.

On my drive back, I was reflecting on what was said, but more importantly, what was not said. There was no talk of lunches, benefits, gyms, flexible working hours, or any of that sort. The word **balance** wasn't mentioned even once.

There was only talk of customer obsessions. There was talk of solving problems at scale - imagine the biggest problem you can, and 10x it. There was talk of having a community of hard working, intelligent, and honest peers who are there to help you and do their best work.

I raised my hand, I made some jokes, and I asked questions. Each and every Amazonian truly embodies Amazon's values. It's why some people spent their entire careers there, why some people left and returned.

## The Open House Event

I have to give a shout out to the organizers. The event was extremely well organized, and meticulously planned.

It had the right ratio of talks, panels, Q&A, and breaks in between. We've all been in overly packed schedules that simply lead to exhaustion.

The ratio of guests to Amazonians was just right. I'd estimate there to be ~35 attendees and ~15 Amazonians in total. It felt just right, not overcrowded, and an opportunity to meet with everyone there.

I had the opportunity to learn what it was like to work at Amazon in 2000, what it's like to onboard to Amazon in 2025, and talk to various engineering leaders in the industry spanning from Space to biotech and everything in between.

## So what do I think?

Overall, I'm just grateful for the people I met, the conversations I had, and the ideas I got.

I'm on my enterpenturial journey, and I'd love to create the same type of Principal Engineering community that Amazon has.

If you're a Principal+ Software Engineering, I'd highly recomment reaching out to their recruiting team. It's a no frills, no fluff, no games, just a chance to chat with some of the smartest people in the industry.

[1] I like to call the Amazon Spheres "Bezos' Balls". To build a company as big as Amazon, you need some big balls, and two is not enough. ðŸ™ƒ
[2] As a "software first" individual, I test and leverage the latest AI tools as much as possible every single day. I've been using GitHub Copilot since 2021 and can't imagine going back to a world where I don't have ChatGPT and Claude subscriptions. I asked people across Amazon, NASA and Blue Origin about their team's experiences with AI tools. For some reason, the people at the ground floor of "real engineering" are slow to adopt these tools. The opportunity here is massive, and it's just a matter of time. I'll save the details for a separate post but now I have a goal and direction to deserve a spot at the [Mars Conference](https://marsconference.com/).
