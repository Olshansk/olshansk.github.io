Goal: "Enable every human to achieve their full potential".

- Laziness
- Intrinstic Motivation
- Health
- Mental capacity
- Neural plasticity
- Time
- Focus

We got pretty deep into the AI, humanity, etc yesterday as well, and ultimately someone asked me: "Daniel - so what's your actual goal."

My answer was: "Enable every human to achieve their full potential."

Whether that means happiness, intrinsic motivation, lack of limitation of capital resources, focus, having the right software/hardware tools in place, etc, it really helped me summarize everything into one sentence.

My friend is focused on "the human condition.

Fwiw, this is where I'd give Zuck kudos because his mission has always been: "To give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together."

How work manifests to achieve it has varied (facebook, whatsapp, VR, etc), but it hasn't changed.
