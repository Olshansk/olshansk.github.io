### State Shift Day Announcement

Two weeks ago we released the first set of Shannon-migration resources. You can catch up [here](https://medium.com/decentralized-infrastructure/pocket-network-shannon-migration-announcement-139c25e4166c).

**The hard fork is locked in for June 3, 2025 at 10 a.m. PT.**

In honor of Claude Shannon's work on bit manipulation in the context of Information Theory and Signal Processing, we're calling the event **_State Shift Day_**.

This upgrade is a major step to unlocking native interoperability, maintainability, and most importantly, the technical capability to iterate quickly so we can achieve our [long-term roadmap](https://forum.pokt.network/t/shannon-post-launch-development-roadmap/5497).

### What happens on State Shift Day?

The Pocket Network Foundation ðŸŒ€, with support from Grove ðŸŒ¿, will perform the following sequence:

1. **Morse Snapshot** â€” capture the Morse MainNet state.
2. **State Transform** â€” convert that snapshot into a Shannon _genesis-like_ state object, with one-off adjustments for special cases (e.g. highly-staked validators).
3. **Shannon Upload** â€” publish the state transform to Shannon, opening token-claim windows.
4. **Morse Rewards Off** â€” adjust `RelayToTokenMultiplier` on Morse to **0**; turning off the production of new tokens removing incentives for any actor (Validator or Supplier) to continue participating in the network.
5. **Traffic Shift** â€” Gateways (including Grove) begin rerouting traffic from Morse to Shannon.

### What happens after?

Migrating a live, permissionless network **_and_** changing its cryptographic key scheme has never been done â€” per all the conversations we've had with other Web3 organizations â€” so we're pushing the frontier.

Our priority is to minimize downtime for users while giving every participant a clear path forward.

Here is what we anticipate to happen and follow in the days and weeks following State Shift Day:

- **Token Claims** â€” Sovereign POKT holders can claim immediately. The Foundation will maintain the upgrade functionality for one year after the Shannon cutover date to make sure that everyone with a Morse wallet has had a chance to upgrade to Shannon.
- **Centralized Exchanges** â€” CEXs will (likely) briefly pause POKT deposits/withdrawals while claiming on behalf of customers. Most already support Cosmos-style chains, so we anticipate a smooth process. There is a risk of delisting as well.
- **Morse Actor Migration** â€” With incentives gone, we expect all Suppliers and Validators to quickly move from Morse to Shannon.
- **Morse Chain Halt** â€” As Validators stop signing Morse blocks and exchanges disable trading, Morse will naturally halt.
- **Shannon MVP Tooling** â€” Over the following weeks, we'll prioritize feedback from the community and focus on tooling to ensure a smooth continued transition, as we begin onboarding new ecosystem participants.

_If you rely on Grove's portal, we expect brief interruptions. We are aware that Grove and Pocket Network act as a backup RPC provider for major services, so please ensure that you have another backup during State Shift Week._

### Thank you

State Shift Day is the first concrete step toward a [**crypto-native API layer**](https://dev.poktroll.com/). On behalf of Grove Inc. and the Pocket Network Foundation, thank you for building the next internet with us. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ€
