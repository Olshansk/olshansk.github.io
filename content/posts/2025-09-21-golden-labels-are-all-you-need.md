## tl;dr

- Data has three Pillars: 1) Quantity 2) Quality 3) Granularity.

- What we specialize in: 1) Very high quality 2) Medium Quantity 3) Very low granularity

High Quality data requires three things: 1) Experts 2) Incentives 3) Atmosphere

Why GoldenSwipe? This is how you break through the data wall for custom models.

The Three Pillars of Data

Image:

- 2010s social ML and ads: big data, low quality, variying ganularity
- RLHF: High quality, small data, variing granularity
- ScaleAI & Surge: High quality, small datahigh granuliary, small data
- What I’m building: REALLY high quality, medium size data, VERY low granularity. This will break through the wall.

## Setting up for Expert Quality

How we do this?

- We need to pay specialists very high sums
- Lawyers like wages to specialists (engineers, docttors, etc)

Human psychology:

- Focusing is hard
- Focusing requires not just self discipline, but also the right environment
- We need to do both

## GoldenSwipe’s Speciality

It can be done from anywhere, but I want to wine & dine them.

- Coffee. Food. Etc.

They need to be comfortable.

- UI / UX: Inspired by tinder Swipe
