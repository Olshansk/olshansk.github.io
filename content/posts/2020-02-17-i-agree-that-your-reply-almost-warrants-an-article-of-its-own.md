I agree that your reply almost warrants an article of itâ€™s own :)

To be honest, the fact that Embed.ly works with multi-file gists when you specify the file name, it really makes me wonder what (and why) medium is doing on the backend?

The proxy provider solution seems viable but a bit of an overkill IMO if itâ€™s possible to avoid.

Itâ€™d be great if [Medium Engineering](https://medium.com/u/d0bbc53072f4) could look at this, and ideally, even avoid the preprocessing step thatâ€™s making things complicated. ðŸ¤žthat they respond.
