OpenAI published an [article](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence) today on the importance of Governance of Superintelligence. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least half the readers, like myself, went straight to ChatGPT to ask for its ideas on governing itself.

I pasted the entire article but cropped it out for the purpose of this postThe tl;dr is that we should hopefully figure it out within the next decade, but international tensions are the biggest risks we need to account for.

There’s a lot of iteration we could do here, but I was content with the response for such an open-ended abstract problem. I decided to get some feedback on how I approached the problem, and you can find the full transcript exported as Markdown [here](https://gist.github.com/Olshansk/a1360e04a1c0527fb7b40994bd573b46).

Next, I decided to have some fun with the image and title for this post.

And lastly, I couldn’t resist asking about Blockchains.
