Fees are a metric worth looking into but I would say that the story they tell is more of how sustainable the network is as opposed to the adoption rate by the general public.

They’re actually growing at a much higher rate than I had expected! I think this is healthy given how BTC will probably be a settlement network and lightning networks will be used for everything else.

I agree with you regarding spam attacks and other one-off events.

Also, I think it might be wroth omitting the outliers (like I did in my second graph) from the delta price / delta trans the graph so a clearer picture is seen.
