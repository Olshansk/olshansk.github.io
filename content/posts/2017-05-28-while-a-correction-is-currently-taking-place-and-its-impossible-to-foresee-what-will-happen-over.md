While a correction is currently taking place, and it’s impossible to foresee what will happen over the coming months, my opinion is that the realm of possibilities with blockchain technology is still in it’s infancy.

I don’t think we’ll see real stability until it’s adopted by mainstream organizations, which could very well take at least ten years. By then, the market cap of all cryptocurrencies, in my opinion, will far exceed a trillion dollars.
