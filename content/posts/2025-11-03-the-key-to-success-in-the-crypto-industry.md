I've seen dozens of crypto projects fail.

I've seen a handful crypto companies succeed.

To achieve success, a lot of hard things need to align correctly. To achieve failure, only one important thing needs to deviate from the right path.

The one differentiating factor which I've seen, time and time again, **lead to failure** in the crypto industry is: **biasing to idealism over pragmatism**.

As someone who had joined the industry for its ideals, it took me years to learn this lesson...

## Not about Memes & Casinos

This post is about the crypto projects that are trying to create utility. A real, new product, with net new value. It is not about the projects that are trying to extract value.

I'd be amiss if I didn't mention that memes & casinos. Like vice industries in the real world, they also have Product-Market-Fit (PMF). But, they're not my cup of tea. In my opinion, these projects are about extracting or redistributing value value, rather than creating it.

**In other words, my focus is on those who are trying to grow the pie rather than those trying to get the biggest slice.**

_Now that I got the disclaimer out of the way, let's get into it..._

## Changing my mind

I've had my foot in the crypto industry since 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/). I've spent the last four years in the crypto industry fulltime.

Having your foot in the industry is how you absorb and learn. Working it in fulltime is when you are forced to make tradeoffs and ultimately change your mind.

The list of Pragmatic successes below is what I often reference in conversations when I discuss the bias to idealism over pragmatism. I found myself saying this more than a handful of times now, so I thought I'd share it here.

## Pragmatic Successes

**PolyMarket (Prediction Markets)** - Back in 2016, [Augur](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software)>) and [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/ten-years-of-gnosis-from-prediction-markets-to-a-user-owned-open-finance-revolution) were the ones who kicked off the decentralization prediction market space. These projects introduced me to the concept of [The Wisdom of the Crowds](https://olshansky.info/book/the_wisdom_of_crowds). Most people haven't heard of Augur, and likely only know of Gnosis as a crypto safe or credit card company. With that said, many people have likely heard of PolyMarket, especially after their recent [$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). What do I think was the key to PolyMarket's success? Using stablecoins instead of having a custom token on day 1. I don't know if PolyMarket will plans to ever have it's own token, but I'm the topic comes up every now and then. However, they were pragmatic in their launch strategy. They focused on the core value proposition, attracted and attracted right crowd rather than being [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by shiny tokenomics.

**Solana (Permissionless)** - Solana's vision was to build a blockchain that operates at the speed of the Nasdaq. One of the ideals in crypto is that anyone should be able to be part of the network. In technical terms, that means running a full node on your phone or a validator in your basement. In practice, this requires professional DevOps engineers. The equivalent of maintaining a solana validator is like needing to be an F1 race car driver to drive a car on the streets. This came with tradeoffs: decentralization vs speed. They chose pragmisism (speed) over idealism (decentralization), which obviously paid off; they have a $91B market cap as I'm writing this.

**Stablecoins** - The original vision of Bitcoin was to have a financial system divorced from the financial system. Unless you've been living under a rock, you've likely seen that [Stablecoin volume is at $46T annually](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/). Companies like [Circle are IPOing at deca billion dollar](https://investor.circle.com/news/news-details/2025/Circle-Announces-Pricing-of-Upsized-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx) market caps. The [GENIUS act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) was passed introducing regulatory clarity. Stablecoins are fundamentally antithetical as crypto can be, but they're going parabolic without any hint of slowing down. It seems obvious and logical in hindsight, but required letting go of ideals for the few companies that started it years ago.

**CoinBase (Centralized Exchange)** - Another ideal of crypto is for everyone to maintain their own private keys. There's a common phrase: _Not your keys, not your coins._ Coinbase, one of the leading advocates of crypto regulations and increasingly achieving Bitcoin's original mission succeeded because they are a custodian of your keys. For what it's worth, I don't see it as a bad thing. It gives users optionality, they're using their capital for good, but it was founded on making a pragmatic tradeoff to build a product.

**Privy (Wallet Infrastructure)** - Privy is arguably one of the most successful wallets. It's mission is to bring people onchain, and I've heard dozens of people talk about how its the best thing to have happened to the crypto industry. But, they don't have a token, they're not "crypto first", they leverage AWS infrastructure very heavily to store user keys [1]. I'd say a big contributor to their success is the fact that their CEO & co-founder, [Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer on FileCoin; a decentralized storage solution. The promise of FileCoin is one of true crypto ideals, so I'm sure he knew where and when to make pragmatic tradeoffs afterwards.

**Anything in life requires tradeoffs and balance**. In crypto, the difference is that it's not about weighing the pros and cons of two alternatives, but rather letting go of ideals to remain pragmatic.

## It's never _just_ that simple

As I said earlier, failure can be the result of just one thing, but success is almost always the result of many things.

You need to have a good UI, UX and educate your users. Timing is critical. You need a team that can execute. You need to build a product people actually need. The list goes on...

However, a lot of people who get into the crypto industry are usually ideals driven.

While pragmatism won't guarantee success, idealism can be a death sentence.

The only two exceptions to these are Bitcoin, Ethereum and ZCash.

## A thought to end things on

One thing I say is that **Decentralization is a byproduct of a Permissionless & Incentivized system**. It's an end to a means, not a means to an end.

In theory, a world where everything is private, permissionless and decentralized, without making any tradeoffs on reliability, cost and performance is great.

We might be able to reach it one day, but that's a very idealistic viewpoint. Unless you have an infinite amount of time and capital, you need to be pragmatic. You need to make tradeoffs that bias to pragmatism over idealism if you want to succeed.

## tl;dr Practical Tips to be Pragmatic over Idealistic

1. **Don't tokenize prematurely**: Start with a stablecoin (or fiat on-ramp) rather than a custom token (or avoid it altogether)
2. **Don't decentralize prematurely**: Start with a standard Web2 centralized approach, architected in a way that doesn't hinder decentralization later.
3. **Start with PMF**: Once you found PMF, the world is your oyster. You can choose if/when to tokenize, decentralize, etc.

[1] It's ironic because Signal, the messaging app considered to be the most privacy focused, hosts most of their infrastructure on [AWS as well](https://www.theverge.com/news/807147/signal-aws-outage-meredith-whittaker). Putting aside their somewhat unlucky October 2025, it clearly provides what customer need to build privacy preserving Clearly it's a good solution if.
