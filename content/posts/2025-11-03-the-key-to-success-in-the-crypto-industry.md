I've seen dozens of crypto projects fail.

I've seen a handful crypto companies succeed.

To achieve success, a lot of things need to happen and align. But, a system is only ever as weak as it's weakest link.

There is one differentiating which I've seen, time and time again, lead to failure. I, for one, also held on to it for years before being able to let it go.

**A sure way to failure in the Crypto industry is to bias to Idealism over Pragmatism.**

## Not about Memes & Casinos

This post is about the crypto projects that are trying to create real product, value and utility.

Memes & Casinos are not my cup of tea, but I'd be amiss if I said they don't have Product-Market-Fit (PMF).

In the legal sphere, alcohol, drugs and prostitution all have PMF to various degrees. But, those are not the industries I'd like to spend my time in.

Build a crypto project that's funded by, enable by, or revolves around memes & casinos is also a legitimate way to do a thing. However, it is up to the foundating team to make those tradeoffs.

Pragmitism and Idealism don't apply to memes & casisnos. Alas ,but I had to call it out because it is, unfortunately, a major part of the industry.

## Changing my mind

I've had my foot in the crypto industry since 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on gitter. I've spent the last four years in the crypto industry full-time.

I'd say that having your foot in the industry is how you absorb and learn. Working it in full-time is when you make hard tradeoffs and change your mind.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of successes that really shaped how I think about finding PMF and the tradeoffs that need to be made. It's more of a maturing and coming of age than learning. Everyone who's been around long enough will know what I mean.

## Pragmatic Successes

**Prediction Markets** - Augur and Gnosis were the _OG_ prediction markets back in 2016. They were the ones who introduced me to the concept of _The Wisdom of the Crowds_. Most people haven't heard of Augur, and likely only know of Gnosis as a crypto safe or credit card company. Many people have likely heard of PolyMarket, especially after their recent [$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). What do I think was the key to PolyMarket's success? Using stablecoins instead of having a custom token on day 1. I don't know if PolyMarket will ever, or plans to ever, have it's own token, but I'm sure the topic came up. However, they were pragmatic in using something simpler, which does not attract the wrong crowd, prevents a distration from the core utility, and focused on the core value proposition.

**Solana** - The ideal vision in crypto is that anyone should be able to be part of the network. In technical terms, that means running a full node on your phone or a validator in your basement. In practice, this requires professionals. The equivalent of running a solana validator is like needing to be an F1 race car driver if you want to drive a car on the streets. This came with tradeoffs, but they remained pragmatic rather than idealistic and have had their own success.

**Stablecoins** - The original vision of Bitcoin was to have a financial system outside of the financial system. Unless you've been living under a rock, you've likely seen that [Stablecoin volume is at $46T annually]. Companies like circle are IPOing at deca billion dollar market caps. The GENIUS act was passed introducing regulatory clarity. Stablecoins are as anthithetical as crypto can be, but they're going parabolic without any hint of slowing down. It's logical now, but require letting go of ideals for the few companies that started it years ago.

**CoinBase** - Another ideal of crypto is for everyone to maintain their own private keys. There's a common phrase: _Not your keys, not your coins._ But, Coinbase, one of the leading advocates of crypto regulations and increasingly achieving Bitcoin's original mission succeeded because they are a custodian of your keys. For what it's worth, I don't see it as a bad thing. It gives users optionality, they're using their capital for good, but it was founded on making a pragmatic tradeoff to build a prduct.

**Privy** - Privy is arguably one of the most successful wallets. It's mission is to bring people onchain, and I've heard dozens of people talk about how its the best thing to have happened to the crypto industry. But, they don't have a token, they're not "crypto first", they leverage AWS infrastructure very heavily to store user keys [1]. I'd say a big contributor to their success is the fact that their CEO & co-founder, [Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer on FileCoin; a decentralized storage solution. The promise of FileCoin is one of true crypto ideals, so I'm sure he knew where and when to make pragmatic tradeoffs afterwards.

**Anything in life requires tradeoffs and balance**. In crypto, the difference is that it's not about weighing the pros and cons of two alternatives, but rather letting go of ideals to remain pragmatic.

## It's not that simple

As I said earlier, failure can be the result of just one thing, but success is almost always the result of many things.

You need to have a good UI, UX and educate your users. Timing is critical. You need a team that can execute. You need to build a product people actually need. The list goes on...

However, a lot of people who get into the crypto industry are usually ideals driven.

While pragmatism won't guarantee success, idealism can be a death sentence.

The only two exceptions to these are Bitcoin, Ethereum and ZCash.

## An ending thought

One thing I say is that **Decentralization is a byproduct of a Permissionless & Incentivized system**. It's an end to a means, not a means to an end.

In theory, a world where everything is private, permissionless and decentralized, without making any tradeoffs on reliability, cost and performance is great.

We might be able to reach it one day, but that's a very idealistic viewpoint. Unless you have an infinite amount of time and capital, you need to be pragmatic. You need to make tradeoffs that bias to pragmitism over idealism if you want to succeed.

Signal is one of the leading messengers, but they're still dependent on AWS.

Will signal decentralzie? Probably.

But, they started with AWS, and you probably don't even know about the 20 alternatives out there which are _actually decentralized_.

- That's it. I'm providing a few quick examples below but might a longer post in the future.

Note: This is a quick thought of a longer post I plan to write reflecting on four fulltime years in the crypto industry.

[1] It's ironic becase Signal, the messaging app considered to be the most privacy focused, hosts most of their infrastructure on [AWS as well](https://www.theverge.com/news/807147/signal-aws-outage-meredith-whittaker). Putting aside their somewhat unlucky October 2025, it clearly provides what customer need to build privacy preserving Clearly it's a good solution if

ot too different from how signal uses AWS infrasstructure.
