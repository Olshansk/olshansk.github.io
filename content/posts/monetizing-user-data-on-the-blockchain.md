### Monetizing User Data on the Blockchain

Note: This is a repost of a blog published in early 2018.

With the advent of blockchain technology there has been a lot of discussion surrounding the monetization of user data. While this idea is great in theory, it took me a while to understand how something like this could be implemented in practice.

Depending on the type of user data at hand, it could be hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes in size. Blockchain is a distributed ledger and should not be thought of as an alternative to cloud storage. Though there are projects such as [Sia](https://sia.tech/), [Storj](https://storj.io/) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) working to build a distributed cloud, these projects are nascent and transfer the burden of paying for data storage directly to the user. There is a reason why Google is willing to store your photos for free, and it’s not a form of altruism. However, most of the people I’ve talked to still opt for using Google’s services.

As long as people care more about saving money than having self sovereignty over their data, they will have to sacrifice censorship resistance. If you choose to use Google to store your photos, you must understand that they can delete your photos or lock out your account at any point in time. Even if you encrypt all of your photos before saving them to the cloud, they are still in control of your data. For the rest of this article assume that the user is willing to sacrifice censorship resistance to a company named Hooli, who is offering to host the user’s data in exchange for a small cut.
