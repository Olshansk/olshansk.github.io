*This is a post in a series of articles I‚Äôm writing called ‚Äú5 points & 1 resource‚Äù (think tl;dr but 5p;1r), where I summarize a list of 5 concepts that would have helped me start learning or re-learning a certain topic. It is intentionally far from a complete source of data.*

*Edit: Thank you to [Aaron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhenhuangao/) (one of the JMT authors) for reviewing this post.*

- An **Addressable Merkle Tree (AMT)** is a cryptographically authenticated deterministic data structure backed by a key-value store database used for account-based (non-UTXO-based) systems to map keys (i.e. addresses) to arbitrary binary data in each leaf node.

- An **Addressable Radix Merkle Tree (AR·µ£MT) **[Fig. 3] is a generalization of an AMT, a binary tree, where *r > 2*. With a key size of *h* bits, and each node having at most *r* children, the height of the tree is *log·µ£(2 ∞)*. The tradeoffs of *r* are:

A **large r** is good for read-heavy applications but results in greater write amplification and higher storage costs when updating internal path nodes.

- A **small r** is good for write-heavy applications, but results in higher I/O when querying or updating the tree.

- A **Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) **[Fig. 2] is an AMT which accounts for the fact that Perfect Merkle Trees are never needed for account-based models since most keys will not have data, thereby removing the need to store *2 ∞ *keys. The two main optimizations are:

**Empty Subtrees** are replaced with a constant default placeholder node value.

- **Single-Leaf Subtrees** are replaced with one node reflecting the one leaf value.

- A **Jellyfish Merkle Tree (JMT)** is a Sparse Addressable Radix Merkle Tree with *r=16* (**Sparse AR‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜMT) **that balances the tradeoff of storage, compute, read and write operations using two node types: **Internal Node** and **Leaf (Data) Node. **It optimizes for Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) based key-value storage databases (e.g. RocksDB) by using **Version-Based Node Keys** whereby a monotonically increasing version number (i.e. # of transaction applied to the state) is prefixed to the node path in order to [Table 1]:

- Automatically sort node updates written (i.e. appended) to disk in lexicographic order, reducing the disk bandwidth and IOPS of LSM-tree compaction.

- A JMT has an average **Merkle Proof size of Œò(ùëôùëúùëî(num_existent_leaves))** and is split into three types [Fig. 4,5]:

**Inclusion proof** - A path to the node leaf with the appropriate key exists.

- **Exclusion proof (other node)** - The leaf node in the path followed contains a key different from what‚Äôs expected.

- **Exclusion proof (empty node)** - An empty (i.e. default placeholder) node exists along the path to the leaf node with the expected key.
