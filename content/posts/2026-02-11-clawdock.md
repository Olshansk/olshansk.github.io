![ClawDock - Lobsters in Docker containers on a cargo ship](/images/posts/2026-02-11-clawdock-image-01.png)

If you're following AI, unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve likely heard about [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai).

I started setting it up on my computer and had a small _“wait a second” moment: this thing basically has permissions to destroy anything I have, even inadvertently."_

There are already cases of people losing crypto assets, deleting photos, etc.

Then I read Simon’s short post on running [OpenClaw in Docker](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/openclaw-docker).

Having used Docker extensively myself, I know that even once it’s running, you’re going to run into the same 10 questions every time you want to actually _use_ it.

So, introducing: **ClawDock**. The bash helpers you needed but didn't know about.

It'll make it easier to work with OpenClaw in a dockerized environment on your machine. No remote servers. No Mac Minis.

## QuickStart (opinionated)

**Make sure you have the repo cloned**:

```bash
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:openclaw/openclaw.git
```

**Download the bash script**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.clawdock
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/scripts/shell-helpers/clawdock-helpers.sh -o ~/.clawdock/clawdock-helpers.sh
```

**And source it in your `.rc` of choice**:

```bash
echo 'source ~/.clawdock/clawdock-helpers.sh' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Once you run `clawdock-help`, you’ll see all of the options below. Just follow the “First Time Setup” and you should be good to go.

For reference, here's the PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/12817

_NOTE: This is just the first version of clawdock. More coming soon._
