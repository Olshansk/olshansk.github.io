### Pocket Network Shannon Migration Announcement

[Pocket Network](https://pokt.network/) will undergo a major, consensus-breaking, non-backwards-compatible migration from Morse to Shannon **before the end of Q2.**

The exact date will be finalized based on community feedback — ***your input matters****. You can read more about our [shadow MainNet launch](https://medium.com/decentralized-infrastructure/pocket-networks-shannon-upgrade-has-been-successfully-soft-launched-f91f1af8039c) or the [history of the migration](https://medium.com/decentralized-infrastructure/an-update-from-grove-on-shannon-beta-testnet-path-the-past-the-future-5bf7ec2a9acf).

Once a concrete date is set, ecosystem participants will have exactly 14 days to prepare. **This could happen as early as next week**. It is deliberately lower than the 21-day on-chain unstaking time to prevent the gamification of the network.
