- Ryan Perry, when I was 19: "You will review a lot more code than youw rite"
- Up until recently, I had 5 senior engineers on my team, and I was reveiwign a lot of cod
- Today, I:
  - Write a long prompt/spec
  - Ask it to review the code in depth
  - take its time
  - Build a plan
  - Ask quesitons
- We go back and forth
- I focu on:
  - not shitty documentaiton
  - Good toold & make commands
  - Easy for me to run tets
- Once the product works
  - I start reviewing on githb
  - I tell it how to rename, refactor, rewrite
  - I go line by line
  - I structure it well
- This is very necesary so future lLMs follow good pattens
- BUT, I don't write code myself...
- It kind of feels like how tony stark operated
- I don't write code anymore
- Par
