Amazing read showing what a single engineer can do when you actually care about your work.

Loved the post because it also showcased what the real world looks like.

A balance of planning and hacking. Some decisions were data driven, while others were more intuitive. Diving deep into some issues, while letting go of others never to understand the root cause. This is what the real world looks like.

And lastly, another signal that Postgres is likely going to solve all your problems unless you have *really big* data.
