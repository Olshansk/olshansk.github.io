- You're likely tired, but in a good mood that the weekend is about to start
- You're (hopefully) not shipping anything or pushing to production
- You (likely) enjoy work related discussions, and open to changing up context a little bit

## When is a meeting not necessary

- No agenda

## To Sum it up

If you ever want to have a casual call with me, just find my phone number and give me a call between 4-6 pm on Friday afternoone.

The number of times I hear "I had so many meetings today" instead of "I got so much done today" is astounding.

There's a time and place when ge

## Rough Notes

- Just call, don't text
- Schedules are chains
