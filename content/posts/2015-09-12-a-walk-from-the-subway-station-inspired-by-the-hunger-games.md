### A walk from the subway station — inspired by The Hunger Games

Prior to my senior year in College, I made my way through the Hunger Games Trilogy. I read all three books back-to-back in a relatively short period of time. Having spent so much time in Suzanne Collins’ world and writing, I felt as if her writing style had rubbed off on me at the time.

On my first day of my senior year in College, I felt an overwhelming sensation to write something as I exited the subway. It took approximately 7 minutes to walk from the subway to the building where most of my classes were held, during which I wrote the piece below. The content is utter nonsense, but I think it really captures writing style and essence of the hunger games in some way.

Without further ado, please enjoy my writing piece dating about 2 years back:

_I came out of the subway and a sense of bewilderment fled through my veins. It’s hard to believe a place I’ve visited so often could feel so foreign. The buildings are the same, the trees and grass have blossomed as the summer bears it’s end, with enough rainfall in the last couple months to make this place glimmer with a newborn green. Then a mixed pack of emotions suddenly hit me. This is the place where I’ve met so many friends, learned many new things, lived some of my most memorable moments. It’s the place that defines really who I am today. On the other hand, it’s the place that has crushed my mentality, my sense for perfectionism, my drive to always give it 100%. I still want to succeed, but never like I did before._

_As I approach the doors of Bahen lobby, I catch myself taking a deep breath. New year. New start. Let’s not fuck it up this time._

_I go to my usual urinal near the common room. I can still navigate this place with my eyes closed. It’s been engraved into my senses…_
