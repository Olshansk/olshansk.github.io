I recently learnt about [Dr. Arthur Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Brooks) after listening to a few afters of him speaking on [The Modern Wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STBbuMmU20U) podcast and [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGKb3lKfP9Y).

Though I'm sure I would appreciate it, the marginal gains I'd get from reading his book [Build the Life You Want](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137978862-build-the-life-you-want), are likely not worth the time investment given that I've spent north of 4 hours listening to his podcasts.

However, [this short blogpost](https://www.mindbodydad.com/mind/build-the-life-you-want) is worth the read and covers three key points:

1. Cheerleader, Mad Scientist, Sober Judge, or Citizen?
2. More Compassion, Less Empathy and Sympathy
3. The Happiness Paradox: Finding Joy by Letting Go of the Chase

This is an ever shoreter summary of that short blog post of the book, after having listened to the podcasts.

## Cheerleader, Mad Scientist, Sober Judge, or Citizen?

The PANAS (Positive Affect Negative Affect Series) test is a way to categorize the intensity of your positive and negative emotions.

- **Mad Scientist**: Intense emotions in both directions. Passionate, creative and strong need to manage negative feelings.
- **Cheerleader**: Optimistic and upbeat, but struggles with negativity and threats.
- **Poet**: Creative and insightful, but prone to sadness and negative emotions.
- **Judge**: Calm and composed, with low emotional intensity. Ideal for high-pressure professions but appears unenthusiastic.

**Personal Note**: If you're reading this and don't know me, I'm a Mad Scientist. No question. Through the highs and the low

## More Compassion, Less Empathy and Sympathy

**Sympathy**: Passive understanding of another's pain. May lead to pity.
**Empathy**: Active understanding of another's pain. May be emotionally draining.
**Compassion**: Action to improve another's well being. Gnerates strength and purpose.

Compassion is what fuels the desire to take action.

Easier said than done though, right? Yes, and no.

Here are the 4 steps to cultivate compassion:

1. Practice mindfulness
2. Engage in acts of kindness
3. Develop emotional intelligence
4. Embrace Forgiveness

**Personal Note**: I try to do (1) almost every day, I should up the frequency of (2), I started doing (3) at 27, and I have some work to do on (4).

## The Happiness Paradox: Finding Joy by Letting Go of the Chase

Hapiness is found in living a meaningful and purpos-driven life as opposite to an endless pursuit of pleasure and satisfaction.

1. Shift forcus from "Having" to "Being"
2. Pursue Purpose, not Happiness
3. Embrace the Journey, not the Destination
4. Stop Measuring, Start Experiencing

**Personal Note**: I'm improving on (1) every day, I'm pretty good at (2), I'm iterating on (3), and I have my work cut out for me on (4).

_You know what, maybe I should read the book after all..._

> "The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life."

_― Arthur C. Brooks_
