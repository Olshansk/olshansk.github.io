## A Read Through `On Venting`

I have a close friend to whom I vent every once in a while.

He recently shared a post he wrote called [On Venting](https://chanderramesh.com/writing/on-venting/).

I immediately understood why he responds to all of my non-venting messages and pretends as if the vents never happened:

> When folks interact with me, I often skip past the emotional complaints.

---

I like to think I do the following, but it's probably only true half the time—at best:

> Asking for help if one does not know how to solve a problem.

As I kept reading, I realized the post wasn't just a gem—it was a perspective shift. It reminded me of how people like Charlie Munger approached life in their early days.

> Read any biography and it's quite clear that resilient people can in fact compartmentalize quite well, and over time, ignoring certain thoughts and feelings actually decreases their impact.

Something I notice about today's technical leaders—Elon, Peter, Mark, Bill, Satya—is that you never see them venting.
They deal with so much every day that venting probably isn't even on the menu.

I wonder if that composure came naturally, or if they rewired themselves to be that way. It'll be a great question to ask when the opportunity presents itself.

> And as I've said many times, our primary job as a startup is truth-seeking, and any behavior that inhibits this must be ruthlessly stamped out.

This line is pure gold.

> In fact, new managers don't just listen—they often egg on the feeling by sharing their own, similar vents, often at the expense of the bigger picture.

I've been guilty of this. A great reminder to just let it go...

> So when a problem arises, overcoming the activation energy, coming up with a plan, getting buy-in from the bureaucracy, and acting on that plan feels like climbing a mountain.

In other words, venting is choosing the easy path.

> Rewiring your brain is not easy. And over time, with practice, you can actually delay or even reduce the intensity of that initial fight-or-flight response.

That's a powerful idea.

When products like Neuralink start seeing mainstream adoption, I imagine they'll have a _“GLP-1 moment”_ where people suddenly become more focused, more productive, and more in control of their mental energy. Much like how those new drugs help people control their weight today

> The most precious resource we have is not time, but energy.

I love this.

I'd add that energy includes both physical and emotional energy. You need both to focus.

> This will be part of our culture doc and part of our performance review for the next half. Just ask yourself: am I constantly saying things that I wouldn't feel comfortable saying in front of the whole company? Do I constantly engage in DMs instead of commenting in public channels? If not, you don't have to worry!

That's the modern adaptation of _“If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything”_, but applied to a culture of excellence and execution.

## A Couple of Extra Thoughts

Reading through this reminded me of a couple of other quotes.

I recently met someone who said:

> Whenever I feel frustrated, it means I have an opportunity to improve.

I hate that sentence SO MUCH because it's SO TRUE.

And to end on a timeless note, Socrates realized the futility of venting thousands of years ago:

> “Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people.”

― _Socrates_
