If you're reading this, you've definitely heard of [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).

In fact, there’s a good chance you’ve experienced it at some point in your life. You might be feeling it right now.

External validation is a good motivator, but it’s a double-edged sword. If the validation comes from someone willing to pay for your product, take it. If it comes through non-monetary means, be careful.

Something I’ve realized about people who feel Impostor Syndrome frequently is that their internal voice is their own worst enemy. I’m likely projecting here, but I’ll keep going.

Conviction comes internally. Validation comes externally. Self-criticism is the motivator. Results are the reward.

On one day, you might feel like you’re on top of the world and about to build the most successful company ever. Two hours later, you’re convinced there’s no path to success. It’s a daily rollercoaster.

At the same time, you’re afraid everyone around you will see through your facade and expose your incompetence. Yet you also feel like everyone else is incompetent, and that you are uniquely positioned to create something that genuinely adds value to humanity.

**This conflicting internal voice isn’t Impostor Syndrome. It’s the Impostor’s Paradox.**
