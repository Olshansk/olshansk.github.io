Conversations like this with Josef Martens Ph.D. are a great opportunity to stop, zoom out, and reflect on how (and why) we lead.

Tools and tactics are the foundation every leader needs, but leadership itself is about staying resilient and balancing those tools through intuition, experience, and the willingness to make hard calls.

There’s just one tweak I’d make to the article: instead of saying “𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘪𝘯,” I’d say, “𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘥𝘰𝘯’𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘪𝘯, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘺 𝘤𝘢𝘯’𝘵 𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘪𝘵.”

Thanks for the great conversation, Josef!
