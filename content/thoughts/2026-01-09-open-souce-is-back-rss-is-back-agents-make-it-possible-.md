Open source is back. RSS is back.

AI agents are making it possible, if you make your repo AI-first.

One of my open source repos is becoming the de facto source for converting blogs into RSS feeds.

As far as I know, it is what everyone uses as their primary Anthropic RSS newsfeed.

AI agents are making coding easier. Nothing new there.

More importantly, they are making open source contributions easier.

You no longer need to onboard to a codebase.

You do not need to know the language, framework, or tooling.

More importantly, you do not need to know the best practices.

As long as you keep your CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md up to date, with a decent README and some tooling, anyone can jump in.

The idea for a contribution, and kicking it off was still made by a human. They know what we need.

This is where a small micro-tip would go a long way. It's what we're building at [Grove](https://grove.city/).
