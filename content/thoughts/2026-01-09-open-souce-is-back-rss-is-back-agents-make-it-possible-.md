Open source is back. RSS is back.

AI agents make this possible, but only if you make your repo AI-first.

Humans still decide what to do.

One of my open source repos is becoming the de facto way people convert blogs into RSS.

As far as I know, it powers most Anthropic RSS newsfeeds.

I’m getting a surge of new contributors.

Agents make coding easier. That part is obvious.

What is less obvious is this: they make contributing easier.

No onboarding.
No language knowledge.
No framework context.
No best-practice lore.

Keep your http://CLAUDE.md and http://AGENTS.md current, ship a decent README, and anyone can jump in.

The idea still comes from a human. The agent just helps it land.

As a bonus, it would be great if I could send people a useful micro-tip, wherever they already are.

Luckily, it's what we're doing at [Grove](https://grove.city/).
