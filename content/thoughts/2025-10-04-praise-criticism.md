Feedback shouldn't be a one-time or regularly scheduled event.

It's a constant daily process that should happen just-in-time.

It should be critical and unemotional.

The only rule is that you should praise more than you criticize.

In short, remember to praise as often as possible, when deserved, and criticize as soon as possible, when necessary.
