I recently came across a list of 4 key traits of a successful founder,
shared by Yuri Milner — the man who turned a small startup mail-ru into VK.com and invested in Facebook just months before its IPO.

And honestly, his words hit home:

1. Be great at understanding people.
   Because at the end of the day, your team is everything.
   No founder can carry the entire ship alone,
   and finding the right people is a superpower.

2. Be a great storyteller / salesperson.
   Because even the most brilliant product won’t sell itself.
   Stories inspire, attract customers, and build communities.

3. Have at least one person who tells you the truth.
   It could be a spouse, a close friend, or a co-founder.
   But you need someone who will call you out when you’re making a bad decision.

4. A loving family.
   Because when the tough times come (and they will),
   having a solid support system is more valuable than any motivational quote or TED talk.

**Hard Skills**:

- How do you break down a problem?
- How do you solve the problem?

**Soft skills**:

- How do you identify real problems?
- How do you prioritize which problem to solve first?
- How do you sell it?
- How do you explain it?
- How do you get people bought in to help you solve it?
- How do you incentivize, motivate and lead those people?

Timelines:

- Soft skills: later in life
- Hard skills: ealrier in life
- Has to do with neural plascitiy and how the brain develops.
