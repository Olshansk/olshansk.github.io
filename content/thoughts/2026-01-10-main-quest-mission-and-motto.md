I've had a lot of conversations this past week with friends from various walks of life.

These conversations get deep, sometimes meta, and very introspective.

I challenge others, I get challenged myself, and on the other side of the conversation, a little bit of clarity emerges.

This is not something I spent too much time thinking about in my teens and early twenties. But, over the last few years I've spent a lot more time thinking about it and have found a way to articulate it.

The mission is the goal, the motto is the means, and the life quest is the journey.

## My Mission

**Help every human achieve their full potential, starting with myself.**

Whether someone chooses to put the effort to achieve their full potential is up to them. But, no one should be limited from dong so.

I personally believe I have the potential of building a generational company, winning a nobel prize, and writing an autobiography, and being a great son, brother, husband, and father.

I don't think I have the potential of becoming a world-class author, athlete, filmmaker, and that's fine.

In the third leg of my life, once I have achieved my full potential, I want to help every human achieve their full potential.

I believe the key to this will be full control of the mind-body connection, which is where companies like NeuraLink will come into play.

## My Motto

**Inspire my present self.**

I want my present self to inspire my past self, and my future self to inspire my present self.

Whether I'm listening to myself doing an interview on a podcast, or having dinner with myself at different points in life, I want to think: "I want to be that guy."

The motto is what drives my day-to-day actions.

Together, the mission and the motto is what gets me up in the morning, and then leads to taking action.

## My Life Quest

**Bring the construction industry to the 21st century, starting with the geotechnical foundation.**

It's an ambitious goal, and everything I have done, and do today is in service of this goal.

Whether it means building my IQ, skills, EQ, relationships, capital, or reputation, I'm doing is to finish this quest.

## My Current Main Quest

As of writing, my current major quest is to make sure the product at [Grove](https://grove.city) exists in this world.

Creators will always crave creating new content, but they need revenue.

Humans will always crave new experiences, but they need a way to connect.

Agents will always crave novel data, but they need a way to incentivize humans creators to keep doing so.

Stablecoins and new web protocols are the mediums that enable this.

The micro-payment platform that we're building is the paradigm shift that puts it all together.
