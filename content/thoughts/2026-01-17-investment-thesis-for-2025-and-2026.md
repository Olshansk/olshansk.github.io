## Introduction

My general investment thesis is: **Invest in a way that you can sleep well at night**.

There is no right way.

For some people, that means holding everything in cash under a mattress.

For others, it means having 100% allocation in Bitcoin. For others, it means having 0%

## My approach

Everyone likes to invest in ETFs, index funds, or the market, which is generally an analogue to the S&P 500.

Personally, I don't like the S&P 500.

I might like 10 companies, but I don't like the other 490.

I might underperform the market at times, but I can't sleep well at night knowing I'm invested in a ton of companies I don't like.

For example, at the heat of covid, when oil barrels were trading at a negative price, I bought Chevron and ExxonMobil. Not because I like those companies, but because things didn't make sense. Hindsight is 20/20, but at the time it was scary. I \_\_\_ into that fear.

I don't like dollar-cost averaging, nor do I like trading.

The frequency and sizing of my positions and trades are a reflection of my personality, gut, and research.

I like to to some research, and usually buy 1 stock when I get interested in something. It leads me to track the price, get reminded of it every once in a while, and keep it top of mind. It's how I deep my toe.

When I start feeling like I'll miss out on something, I make one big purchase. Then, over time, I'll keep adding to the position, as it goes up or down, and as my conviction changes with new information.

It's more of an art than a science. I think hard, and eventually trust my gut to pull the trigger.

## What changed?

Sometimes the market overreacts to news. That's a good time to reallocate.

Other times, there's a fundamental change in geopolitics or the economy. That's a good time to reallocate.

Right now, AI is changing everything. We are on a path to abundance. Everything that's big will get even bigger. Everything that's expensive will get cheaper. That's a good time to reallocate.

## Q4 2025 Stock Picks

### Google

Google has been on a tear ever since they

Gemini is as as good as Claude (Anthropic) or Codex (OpenAI).

TPUs are the only real competitors GPUs (NVidia).

Advertising isn't going anywhere, it'll just change.

Google knows how to build data centers, and is not going to stop.

Google has been investing in quantum computing for years, and is not going to stop.

Google is still really bad at product. Google is still really good at distribution.

$GOOG is at an all time high, so it's obviously scary to invest more. I've owned some since 2020, and increased my position in Q4 of 2025.

It's currently trading at a P/E of 33 and is worth almost $4T. What are the changes that it doubles to $8T? It's possible.

I see no reason why Google isn't set up to keep innovating on every front that matters over the next decade. The upside isn't 10x, but it's downside is also limited given it's position.

### IREN Technology

- Good at data centers
- Small
- Has a 10x opportunity if played well

## Q1 2026 Stock Picks

### Amazon

Amazon fell behind on the frontier of AI development, but they still

- Good at logistics
- Has distribution
- Good at energy at data centers
- Not going away
- Hasn't made a good AI move yet
- Owns a lot of Anthropic

### Uber

This is a high-level qualitative analysis, approached with a "don't overthink it" mindset. Take it as such.

1. **Ride Hailing Monopoly**

They have a monopoly on the ride-hailing market in the US. Lyft and taxis are not going away, but they are distant second players.

2. **Technical Lead**

The infrastructure for optimal ride hailing is easy to prototype, but takes years of iteration to master.

The traveling salesman problem is NP-complete for a reason.

3. **Price Incentives**

They can increase their prices by 5 percent, and people will not leave.

There is a limit to this, but I believe they are far from it.

4. **Autonomous Vehicle Opportunity**

I worked at Waymo between 2020 and 2022. Their mission is to build the world's safest driver. Whether it is Waymo or someone else that nails this technology and drives adoption, Uber is a beneficiary. It compounds on top of the points above and does not take away from them.

Even if Tesla or someone else turns on a fleet of robotaxis, I see this as a pie that grows rather than one taken away from Uber.

5. **Valuation**

Uber is trading at a P/E of 10 and a valuation of $170B.

In today's world, $170B is something people sneeze at.

A brief look at their [valuation](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/uber/valuation) and [key metrics](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/uber/key-metrics) shows everything trending in the right direction.

6. **Leadership**

Dara Khosrowshahi has been executing and driving, pun intended, the team on every front. Experienced, and balancing the many elements of managing and growing a complex business. No qualms, just trust.

### Copper

- Silver and gold went up
- Copper is needed for chips
- It's next
