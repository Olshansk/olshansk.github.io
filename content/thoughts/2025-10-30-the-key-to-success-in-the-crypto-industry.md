I've seen a lot of crypto projects fail.

I've seen a few crypto companies succeed.

The differentiating mindset that I've seen in those who succeed is quite simple:

> Bias to pragmatism over idealism.

## Not about memes

I'm not talking about memes and casinos here, but those who are trying to do more.

I've been involved in the crypto industry since 2016, and have spent the last 4 years full time.

There are a lot of lessons to share to succeeding, but in reality, there's just one that goes above all else.

## Examples from the Wild

**Prediction Markets** - - Augur and Gnosis had a token on day one. Polymarket is at a 9B valuation without a token. Yes, the timing was also better, the UX, the infrastrcuture was better, but I'd argue that the lack of a token helped.

**Wallets** - - Privy was pragmatic, with the CEO spending 4 years in R&D working on Filecoin.

**Solana** - - Solana has impossible to run validators, but they're still one of the biggest chains

**Stablecoins** - USDC is anthithetical, but not Circle and others are all over it. We have projects that provide "restaking". Think stablecoins but with ETH or Bitcoin as collateral. I see a world where this becomes the standard (one day) but it's idealistic moreso than pragmatic.

**Consensys** - Consensys is planning an IPO, but one of their flagship products is a centralized RPC provider. Infura.

- **Custodial exchanges** - Custodian of Bitcoin - Coinbase started as a custodian of Bitcoin, the most anthithetical thing one can do, but they have a long-term goal. Dexes are big, but they're not custodial.

## It's not that simple

As with anything in life or startups, it's never just one thing.

You need to have a good UI, UX and educate your users. Timing is critical. You need a team that can execute. You need to build a product people actually need. The list goes on...

However, a lot of people who get into the crypto industry are usually ideals driven.

While pragmatism won't guarantee success, idealism can be a death sentence.

The only two exceptions to these are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Decentralization is not a goal

One thing I say is that Decentralization is a byproduct of a Permissionless & Incentivized system. It's an end to a means, not a means to an end.

Signal is one of the leading messengers, but they're still dependent on AWS.

Will signal decentralzie? Probably.

But, they started with AWS, and you probably don't even know about the 20 alternatives out there which are _actually decentralized_.

- That's it. I'm providing a few quick examples below but might a longer post in the future.

Note: This is a quick thought of a longer post I plan to write reflecting on four fulltime years in the crypto industry.
