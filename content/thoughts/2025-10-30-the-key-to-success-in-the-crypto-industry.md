I've been involved in the crypto industry since 2016, and have spent the last 4 years full time.

There are a lot of lessons to share to succeeding, but in reality, there's just one that goes above all else.

**Bias to pragmatism over idealism.**

- Timing, UI, UX, infrastructure is important, but not the key.
- BTC and Ethereum is different

- That's it. I'm providing a few quick examples below but might a longer post in the future.

- USDC is anthithetical, but not Circle and others are all over it.
- Privy was pragmatic, with the CEO spending 4 years in R&D working on Filecoin.
- Solana has impossible to run validators, but they're still one of the biggest chains
- Augur and Gnosis had a token on day one. Polymarket is at a 9B valuation without a token.
- Coinbase started as a custodian of Bitcoin, the most anthithetical thing one can do, but they have a long-term goal.
- Consensys is planning an IPO, but one of their flagship products is a centralized RPC provider. Infura.
- The list goes on...

One thing I say is that Decentralization is a byproduct of a Permissionless & Incentivized system. It's an end to a means, not a means to an end.
