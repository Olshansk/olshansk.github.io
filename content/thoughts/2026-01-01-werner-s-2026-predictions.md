Werner Vogels, the CTO of Amazon wrote about his upcoming predictions.

This note on quantum cryptography is the best take I’ve seen so far w.r.t to its urgency:

> Preparation isn’t something you can put off, the work must begin now, and organizations need to act on three fronts:

> 1. Deploying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) where we can
> 2. Planning to update and replace physical infrastructure where we can’t
> 3. Developing quantum ready talent to support this transition.

Luckily, not all is lost:

> The good news is that PQC solutions exist and are deployable now at the OS level, the browser level, and in the cloud […]

> Apple integrated quantum-safe protocols into recent iOS and macOS releases.

> Google switched Chrome to quantum-resistant encryption.

> AWS deployed the standard across KMS (Key Management Service), ACM (Certificate Manager), CloudFront, Secrets Manager, as well as

> But these are just the first steps.

He also wrote about personalized learning and defense tech, but this is the one that stood out the most. I’m surprised construction didn’t make the list…
