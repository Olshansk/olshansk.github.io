Personally, I think we’re entering an era where acquisitions will be more common than IPOs.

The bubble is not bursting, but it's not growing at the same rate as it used to, and there's not much more air to fill it. VC money is drying up, and seeing how most startups still can’t turn a profit but have valuable IP, an acquisition is a good out for shareholders and investors.

In the past year there have also been quite a lot of mergers and acquisitions for companies of both large and small scale. When the market becomes bearish, it’s hard for companies to keep growing and competing, so a merger or acquisition is often the right path.

Maybe I’ll investigate that in my next article if I can find a good data source.
