I couldn’t agree more.

Having grown up in a reform Jewish household, I always enjoyed the holidays and just having a reason to get together as a community and celebrate. Arguably, you don’t need a reason to celebrate, but tradition kind of served as a calendar that everybody worked their schedules around. However, I think that religion itself is an outdated concept in a modern society.

Like you said, religion serves to provide a strict set of rules to live by. This was very important and necessary in the early days of human civilization when no prior rules existed, but that is no longer the case. We now have a central government, laws, order (more or less), and those who still abide by rules from centuries ago hinder themselves from reaching their full potential.
