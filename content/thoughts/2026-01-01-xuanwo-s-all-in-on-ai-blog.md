Xuanwo recently published his [how I code in 2025](https://xuanwo.io/2025/08-how-i-coding-nov-2025-edition/) and a longer [2025 all in recap](https://xuanwo.io/2025/09-2025-review/).

From his first post, my takeaway is that we use very similar tools.

The one exception is that he leveled up on managing multiple workspaces, whereas I simply make multiple clones of my repo.

I just downloaded [Conductor](https://www.conductor.build/) so we'll see how it goes.

From his second post, I can tell that our view and philosophy are very similar.
