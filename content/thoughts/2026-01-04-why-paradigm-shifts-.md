I've been reflecting on my career up until this point.

A common pattern I keep seeing is that I always aim to work on paradigm shifts.

It’s been interesting, fun, fulfilling, adventurous, and a learning journey in every aspect of life.

However, it hasn’t gotten me closer to achieving my goals.

- In 2011, as an intern, I worked on computer vision algorithms that ran on an iPhone
- In 2014, as an undergraduate senior, I worked on GPU acceleration and distributed systems for fMRI
- In 2016, I got bored working at Twitter and moved to Magic Leap to work on the augmented reality cloud. I turned down an offer from Google and gave up on my Stanford master’s application after taking the GREs.
- In 2020, I moved to Waymo to work on planner evaluation for autonomous vehicles. I turned down an offer from Meta, hanging up the AR/VR hat for a bit.
- In 2021, I tried to change how the construction industry works by building an Airbnb for construction soil
- In 2022, I started building a blockchain to change how applications find and pay for the backend services they need
- In 2025, I started trying to change how tipping will work between agents and humans in the future

But so far, I haven’t achieved any of the goals I set out to:

- Create a product that has either changed the lives of many, changed how we do things, or preferably both
- Build the foundation for a company and brand that I’m proud of and can grow over time
- Set myself on a path to achieve my financial milestones

_If you can relate, you realize how tough this is._

Needing to work on paradigm shifts is a luxury. I’m not sure I deserve it.

It’s analogous to working at a big company versus building one yourself.

Why don’t I want to work at a big company? Because I need to be a founder.

Why do I want to be a founder? I can’t just be a cog. I need the freedom to pursue my own ideas, drive my vision, build a team that aligns with my culture, and get involved in every aspect of the business.

If I were alive 150 years ago, I’d probably be a scientist. They were the ones making paradigm shifts back then.

Today, writing and breakthroughs are only one piece of the puzzle. Building a company, a product, and gaining adoption are equally important.

But even 150 years ago, there were business owners who didn’t work on paradigm shifts. So why insist on one?

Breakthroughs inspire me. Founders inspire me. Change inspires me. I want to inspire my future self. I know I’ll get bored and lose excitement if I’m not working on something new.

Paradigm shifts don’t have to be zero-to-one. There can be real, practical milestones along the way, but the long-term direction has to be different. Those milestones pay for and enable the paradigm shift.

When Einstein was writing, he knew there was unexplored territory in physics. When Bill Gates started Microsoft, he knew cheaper computers would change how we operate day to day.

Today, I know the way the construction industry operates 10 years from now will be completely different. There will be some robots, a lot of visual data, and a lot of AI processing it instead of humans.

So why paradigm shifts? Because, like Ovechkin:

> I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.
