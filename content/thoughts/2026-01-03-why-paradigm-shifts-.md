I've been reflecting on my career up until this point.

A common pattern that I've seen is that I always aim to work on paradigm shifts.

It's been interesting, fun, fulfilling, adventurous, and a learning journey in every aspect of life.

However, it hasn't gotten me closer to achieving my goals.

- In 2011, as an intern, I worked on computer vision algorithms that run on an iPhone
- In 2014, as an undergraduate senior student, I worked on GPU acceleration and distributed systems for fMRI acceleration
- In 2016, I got bored of working at Twitter and moved to Magic Leap to work on the Augmented Reality Cloud. I turned down an offer from Google, and gave up on my Stanford master's application after doing my GREs.
- In 2020, I moved to Waymo to work on Planner Evaluate for Autonomous Vehicles. I turned down an offer from Meta, hanging up the AR/VR hat for a bit.
- In 2021, I tried to change how the construction industry works by building AirBnB for construction soil.
- In 2022, I started building a blockchain to change how applications find and pay for the backend service they need.
- In 2025, I started trying to change how tipping will work between agents and humand in the future.

But, so far, I haven't achieved any of the goals I set out to:

- Create a product that has either changed the lives of many, change how he we do things, or preferably, both
- Build the foundation for a company and brand that I'm proud of and can grow over time
- Set me on a path to achieve my financial milestones

_If you can relate, you realize how tough this is..._

Needing to work on paradigm shifts is a luxury. I'm not sure I deserve it it.

But, it's analogous to working at a big company versus building one yourself.

Why don't I want to work at a big company? Because I need to be a founder.

Why do I want to be a founder? I can't just be a cog. I need the freedom to pursue my own ideas, drive my vission, build a team that aligns with my culture, and get involved in every aspect of the business.

If I were alive 150 years ago, I'd probably be a scientist. They were the ones making paradigm shifts back then.

Today, writing and breakthroughs are one piece of the puzzle in paradigm shifts. Build a company, product and gaining adoption is equally as important.

But, 150 years ago, you also had business ownesr who didn't work on paradig shifts, so why a paradim shift?

Breakthoughts inspire me. Founders inspire me. Change inspires me. I want to inspire my future self. I will get bored and lose excitement if I'm not working on something new.

Paradigm shifts don't have to be a zero-to-one. There can be basic milestones along the way, but the long-term direction has to be different. These milestones pay to enable the paradigm shift.

When Einstein was sitting and writing, he knew there was an unexplored part of physics. When Bill Gates started Microsoft, he knew cheaper computers will change how we operate day-to-day.

Today, I know that the way the construction industry will operate 10 years from now will be completely different. There will be rsome robots, a lot of visual data, and lots of AI proessing it instead of humans.

So why Paradigm Shifts? Because, like Ovechkin:

> I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.
