I had a multi-hour conversation with a single Gemini session and noticed that the responses dropped in quality and started coming back very fast.

I'm familiar with context limits and context poisoning, but the sudden brevity still surprised me.

I asked the agent what was going on and found this:

![Gemini](/images/thoughts/geminis-3-line-execution-mode/gemini.png)

It turns out that deep into a work session, 3-line responses are a feature, not a bug.

Nothing too deep here, just a fun way to accidentally stumble onto a technical detail through a random observation.
