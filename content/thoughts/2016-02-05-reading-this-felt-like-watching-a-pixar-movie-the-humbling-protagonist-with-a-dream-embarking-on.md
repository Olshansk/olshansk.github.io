Reading this felt like watching a Pixar movie: the humbling protagonist with a dream, embarking on a long journey, training really hard _insert montage here_, with both highs and lows, making new friends and connections along the way, ultimately culminating in a happy but slightly different than expected ending. You should legitimately consider selling the rights to your story.

You said your goal was to tell a story through dance, and in a way you managed to do it by writing this piece. Your passion for the art and the candidness of your words took me on a wilder emotional rollercoaster than I had originally expected.

Congrats on taking initiative to follow your dream, and for staying positive even when stumbling across some very challenging hurdles. It was a pleasure to read. I can’t wait to hear what’s coming next!
