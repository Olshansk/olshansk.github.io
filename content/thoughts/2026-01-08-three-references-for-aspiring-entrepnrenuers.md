Throughout my career, I've had consistent success getting jobs at other companies, both small and large.

I bring unique ideas and perspectives to the table. I can build and lead small teams. I can communicate clearly and effectively, endure pain, adapt, and I have the hard skills to learn and execute.

I also have well-known weaknesses (impatience, aversion to meetings, self-criticism), but that's not what this post is about.

This post is about my weakest muscles: finding PMF, getting my first real customer, and taking a product from zero to one.

I intend to master this.

Over the past two days, I came across three references that had a meaningful impact on my thinking:

1. [My SaaS hit $2k/mo in 5 months. Here's how I'd do it again from $0](https://www.reddit.com/r/scaleinpublic/comments/1q60ikw/comment/nycuyhy/?context=3) on [r/scaleinpublic](https://www.reddit.com/r/scaleinpublic/)
2. [Watch this to get your first 5 customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7g08dVTwaE) on [r/entrepreneur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7g08dVTwaE) by [Alex Hormozi](https://www.acquisition.com/bio-alex)
3. [how to tweet](https://x.com/EXM7777/status/2007881988779266477) by [Machina](https://x.com/EXM7777)

None of this is new. For a long time, I could explain, regurgitate, and teach the same lessons. Embodying and applying them is different.

I can confidently state that I do a good job creating something from nothing, or scaling something from one to a hundred. The gap I don't yet know how to close is zero to one.

The lessons are simple:

1. Identify a real problem someone is already paying for
2. Shamelessly message everyone you know as you iterate on it for free
3. Communicate effectively, clearly, and concisely
4. Profit
