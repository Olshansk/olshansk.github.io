Side projects are one of those things I go back and forth on.

On one hand, I used to think that if you're so passionate about a side project, why don't you make it your fulltime job?

On the other hand, there are so many reasons to do them:

- You can tinker without getting in anyone's way
- There's no need to plan, prioritize or coordinate with others
- It's a form of "active recovery"
- There's no pressure to deliver results
- It allows you to put yourself in a different mindspace and environment that can bring about new ideas
- No matter how passioante you are about your work, you need to step away sometimes
- ???

_I'll periodically come back here and keep updating this list..._
