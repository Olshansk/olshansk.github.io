There's a quote I heard a little while ago that really stuck with me:

> If you are not a liberal when you are young, you have no heart.
> If you are not a conservative when you are old, you have no brain.

Following up my [recent post about politics](./2025-10-04-changing-my-mind-on-politics),
I have a complementary version to this:

> If you are a young engineer who doesn't hate politics, you have no heart.
> If you are an old engineer who doesn't hate politics, you have no brain.
