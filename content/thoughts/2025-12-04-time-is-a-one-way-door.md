Time is a one way door.

- Spend LESS time caring about the little things
- Spend MORE time on, not necessarily the big picture, but on the one way doors.
- Leadership Hires
- Stack decisionrs
- Gsuite vs microsoft
- Etc...
- What job you commit to
- What partner you commit to
- Google maps is a product I can't live without -> one way adoption
