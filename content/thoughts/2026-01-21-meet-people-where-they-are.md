- Meet people in person
- Users: don't change behaviour. Understand the workflow
- Family and friends: emotion. What happened that day? That afternoon? That week?
- Colleagues: timing. What's the deadline? What's the next step?
- Strangers: chapter in life. What's the story?
- Timing is key. Emotion is key.
- Applies to all relationships
