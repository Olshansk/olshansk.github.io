Just read the CLARITY Act and was impressed by how much technical detail Congress baked in.

This table nails how SEC and CFTC responsibilities split across digital assets. A level of clarity this space has badly needed.

I break tokens into 3 buckets:

1. **ROI** â€“ speculation, memes, perps, yield ðŸ’°
2. **Utility** â€“ stablecoins, rails, infra ðŸ”§
3. **Security** â€“ governance, integrity, privacy ðŸ”’

_The problem is the lines are blurry...._

Discussion often scrambles all three. Until case law and precedent emerge, expect classification to be case-by-case.

I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if a whole new consulting industry emerges. It will spring up just to map projects onto this new taxonomy.

Some other fun facts from the Act:

- Companies can raise **$75M per year** without SEC registration!
- Insiders trained is locked until **mature blockchain status**
- The Howey Test is being replaced with a **Validator Decentralization Test**

Terminology:

- **SEC**: Securities & Exchange Commission
- **CFTC**: Commodity Futures Trading Commission
- **Howey Test**: A test used to determine whether a security is an investment contract or a commodity
- **Validator Decentralization Test**: A test used to determine whether a token is a security or a commodity
