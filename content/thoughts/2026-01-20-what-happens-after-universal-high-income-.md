This post could be shorter, but I agree with the general direction.

Today, working out and living a healthy lifestyle are a choice, not a necessity.

In the future, working and living an intellectually effortful lifestyle will be a choice, not a necessity.

However, it’s a matter of who you want to spend your time around. Remember that you are the average of those you’re surrounded by.

The wealth gap will widen. Poverty will disappear. The bottom 99% will live in abundance.

I will still do my best to be part of the 1%, not because it’ll change what I have access to, but who I have access to.

This was in response to [this substack post](https://substack.com/home/post/p-183644823) by [e1 ventures](https://e1.vc/).
