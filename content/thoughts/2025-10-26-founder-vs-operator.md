**Founders create problems. Operators solve them.**

I've met a lot of executives and CTOs who resonate with two things:

1. They like to solve puzzles.
2. They like to be given an end goal and just make it happen.

The job of a founder is to identify opportunities (i.e. problems), set a vision for what a solution looks like, and build a team that's enabled to get there.

That idea, of course, comes with plenty of qualifiers and caveats. It simply defines a founder's _end goal_ — not their day-to-day.

A founder, especially in the early days, should be able to solve problems themselves and be motivated by the puzzle-solving too.

A great founder should be able to embody the qualities of a great operator when needed.
But a great operator doesn't have to embody the qualities of a great founder.

**Founders create problems. Operators solve them.**

This is an intentionally oversimplified and provocative way to frame it, but it captures something real.

You could argue that a founder is someone who finds unmet needs in the world, or is driven by a mission.

And saying operators don't create problems undervalues those who innovate within systems and make them stronger.

If you're reading this, I hope you have the ability — and the opportunity — to do both.
