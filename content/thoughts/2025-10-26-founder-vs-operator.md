**Founders create problems, operators solve them.**

I've met a lot of executives and CTOs who resonate on two points:

1. They like to solve puzzles
2. They like to be given an end goal and just make it happen

The job of a founder is to identify opportunities (i.e. problems), set a vision of what a solution looks like, and hire a team that's enabled to get there.

The idea above obviously comes with a lot of qualifier and caveats. It defines a founder's end goal.

A founder should, especially in the early days, be able to solve the problems themselves, and be motivated by the puzzle solving as well.

A great founder should be able to embody the qualities of a great operator depending on the circumstance, but a great operator doesn't have to be able to embody the qualities of a great founder.

**Founders create problems, operators solve them.**
