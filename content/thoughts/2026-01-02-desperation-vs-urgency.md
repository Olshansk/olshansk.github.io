A great 2-minute post by Ross Lazerowitz, CEO at https://www.miragesecurity.ai/

The playbook for enterprise software is:
1. Cold outreach
2. Design Partners
3. First Cohort

Love it.

But, he calls out that **desperation != urgency**.

Being able to sell and raise doesn’t mean success. It means you might get stuck in a local minima. User need to line up for your product.

His key takeaway is:
> Go slow to go fast. Don’t spin up marketing and a sales team until you feel that pull. If you can’t close $1M without marketing spend and 10 AEs, you might be building something middling. Don’t get distracted by desperation if you can’t find urgency.
