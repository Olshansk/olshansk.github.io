🛑 Note for the men here (You're gonna wanna read this!)
I posted this before but they've been alot of new members since.

I often receive messages like: “Why did she say no? I’m attractive so what’s wrong?” , “Did you show her my picture? Send her another one” ,“Did you tell her I’m wealthy?”

I sat a while to write this and I want to say this with the best intentions. Having seen the 'behind the scenes', I want to break down what makes you attractive to a girl.

! Taking care of your mental, emotional, and physical health - this is a huge one. Read it again.

!! Not smoking, not gambling, and avoiding heavy drinking.

!!! Not having 100s of female friends when you're seriously looking for a wife.

!!!! Not saying you’re “just taking it easy”.

!!!!! Scheduling a date. Don’t constantly reschedule.

!!!!!! Don't tell someone that she’ll be your wife on the first date, let things grow naturally.

!!!!!!! Sticking to your values is very attractive.

!!!!!!!! Making sure she knows where she stands. If you think keeping her waiting for days before setting another date will create mystery or attraction, think again. It creates uncertainty and drains her interest! Anyone who told you to wait x amount of time to reply or plan is most likely not a person who is in a happy relationship themselves, mark my words.

If you're not showing consistency, emotional maturity, and a solid character, a healthy person will most likely not be interested in you, or will lose interest quickly.

Be real with yourself. Women are looking for emotional safety. If you focus on building those qualities, you’ll be amazed how much more magnetic you become, not just in dating, but in life.

Trust me because I see who's attracted to who and who sticks, and it's not based on the superficial things you would think it is!

Hope this is at least a little bit helpful and don’t worry, a note for the women is coming next :)

Now a note for the Women (Yes, it's important)

'He said he had a good time so why didn’t it go anywhere?'
! What truly matters is whether someone’s actions align with their words. Pay attention to patterns. Actions speak louder than words, remember that.

!! Be confident no matter how old you are, confidence is powerful and very attractive when it’s rooted in self-worth, not ego. There's a big difference, one is attractive and one is a turn-off.

!!! You don’t need to feel insecure about your age. It means nothing. Meghan Markle married Prince Harry at 36, not because she felt bad for herself! It’s about your energy, how you carry yourself, care for yourself, and view yourself. That vibe is real, and yes, it shows in photos too. Men see that.

!!!! Stop saying, “There are no good guys out there.
You don’t need guy s, you just need one who’s right for you. So be open and change the words you tell yourself, your body hears you and reacts. Shift to speaking positively.

!!!!! Be flexible with your expectations.
If you're 5'3", a 6 ft guy doesn’t need to be a non-negotiable. It’s okay to have preferences, but not at the expense of possibilities! And if you're looking for someone with a certain type of job / income, be realistic- he most probably wont be the one relocating. Consider being open to relocating.

!!!!!! You can change the sweater you don’t like, but not his values. Don’t block a potentially great connection over something that is easily changeable.

!!!!!!! Showing up like you don’t need anyone may feel like power, but it can create distance. Feminine energy isn’t about weakness, it’s about being receptive and present. Men are wired to want to feel needed and appreciated. Independence is beautiful, but connection requires openness.

!!!!!!!! Be clear about what you want and act accordingly. Don’t entertain people who aren’t aligned with your values or goals! Mixed signals lead to disasters!

!!!!!!!!! Stop testing, just communicate. You don’t need to play games to see if he cares. Ask. Speak. The right man will be honest with you and consistent in how he shows up.

!!!!!!!!! Don’t treat a man like a checklist. He’s not a piece of paper and he has flaws just like you do. Stats don’t create deep connection! Shared values, emotional intelligence, and mutual respect do!

!!!!!!!!!!! High quality men want peace, not pressure.
They want loyalty and trust- not drama, fear, or constant testing. Be the peace you're looking for.

Be honest with yourself. The right guy values someone who knows herself. Self-awareness, emotional maturity, and flexibility will take you farther than perfection ever can.

Obviously, both the message for men and the message for women can include points that speak to both sides. I wrote these based on patterns I’ve seen as being behind the scenes, not as a list of what all men or all women need to work on so there’s no need to get defensive. If something you read felt like a pinch, it might actually be a good thing. It means you’re self-aware. And awareness is the first step towards growth and self-work. We’re all learning. I hope this was helpful 🙌🏼

For the new people who joined:

Being posted has been incredibly effective. When you're posted, people see you, and often, someone knows a friend or relative who could be a great fit, even if they’re not directly part of the chat. That’s how many of these matches happened!
Trust me, being posted works!
If you want to be posted, message me directly.

When expressing interest in a post, only reply privately to the post. Do not forward the entire post to me, and do not screenshot it and send it to me.

May this platform lead to many successful new marriages. Amen!

Here are some basic guidelines for the group:

1. Ghosting someone you’ve agreed to meet is not acceptable here. Anyone reported doing that after told so, will be removed from the group.

2. Anyone who messages another member in this chat without prior arrangement will be removed from the group immediately.

3. Note for the men: Schedule a date within two days of connecting. There is no need for extended conversations over a week or more before scheduling a proper date.

4. Forwarding posts from this chat to other chats is strictly prohibited. Any individual found violating this rule will be removed from the chat.

(Please do not call admin, message only, thanks)

They say once you’re happy with yourself everything will fall into place. But how can you be happy with yourself when the things you want most haven’t arrived yet. How are you supposed to feel fully content when the desire to find your person feels so strong?
Redefine what being happy with yourself means for now. It means treating yourself with self care and respect while you’re still wanting wtvr you want.
Keep yourself busy with things that make you feel smarter, more joyful, more liking your appearance, strengthen your confidence in whatever way you know will help you.
Don’t tie your worth to timing. Instead recognize that while waiting, you’re doing things becoming more desirable to yourself and that then naturally reflects outward to others. KNOW that God doesnt have time, everything already exists. KNOW that God wants you to KNOW that He and only He is capable of giving you what you want now, but you need to get to a place of KNOWing it. Its when we become ready enough, strong enough, and wise enough to receive what has been prepared for us.
Talk to yourself the way you would to a friend. And even a minute a day speak to God in your own words. Even just one minute a day, trust me.

‼️Living in a big city creates the illusion of endless dating options and It feels like there’s always someone new, better, or more compatible. BUT IN REALITY, the pool of people who are emotionally available, aligned with your values, and willing to build something is actually pretty small. When you fall for this illusion, you keep moving instead of choosing, and that’s how people get burned out.
Don't fall for the illusion‼️

One piece of advice I can share: whether it's a CEO or a hardworking employee, I've noticed that when I send a message with a potential match to them (men or women), they all check it quickly. So, if someone isn't responding to you, it's a choice- they're deciding not to. No one is ever too busy, trust me, because I see it... No games is the way to get ahead in life if you're truly looking for a life partner.

Remember that by being set up here you're agreeing to:
No double dating. (even if it's a first date)
No ghosting.
No forwarding any messages from this chat.

Why am I so strict about double dating and ghosting someone asked me today.
Beyond the obvious fact that both are completely harmful and disrespectful to others, this is also a space I created and deeply commit myself to. I devote a significant amount of time every day assisting 1000s of people to helping them break dating cycles to committed relationships to marriage.
The time and energy I invest here are not meant to be spent on those who can't understand or accept why double dating and ghosting are disrespectful. There are plenty of other spaces for that. I created this group so carefully to ensure it remains respectful and safe for everyone involved.
These "rules" will not be changing, and they are to your benefit!
