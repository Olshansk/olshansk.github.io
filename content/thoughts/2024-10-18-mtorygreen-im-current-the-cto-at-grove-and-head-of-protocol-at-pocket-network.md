@mtorygreen I'm current the CTO at Grove and Head of Protocol at Pocket Network.

We're launching a full rewrite of Pocket early next year (a migration fully rewritten using the latest Cosmos SDK).

There are some easy lifts we can do to support io.net relaying via pocket then.

Would love to chat when you're open to it.
