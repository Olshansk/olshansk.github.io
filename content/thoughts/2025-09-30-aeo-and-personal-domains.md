I don't have proof, but strong hunch that the time to maintain a blog (personal or work related) on your own domain is now.

Medium/Substack likely have some scraping rules (and handle regulatory issue)
You want to build domain trust
You can add a bunch AEO/SEO tricks in your site so LLMs bias to your site on the next training run
