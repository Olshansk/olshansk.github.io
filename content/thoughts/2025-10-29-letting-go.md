There’s a big difference between letting go and the sun cost.

It’s very delicate. It’s very subtle and it’s very hard to quantify.

If you’re wrong, we do in the moment there’s never way to regret it. If you feel fulfilled at the moment, you’ll never regret it.

The problem with tokens, is that people are injured and can never let it go.

I’m very big on changing my mind.

People say strong opinions weekly held. I wish that was me, but it’s not. I either have a strong opinions or I don’t care.I do change my mind when Information comes in, but I need to sleep and work out first.

- Forward to do it again I’d have no token, and it would be so insurance a time will come
- Talk About being grateful to learn to go to conferences, being comfortable on stage, learning pati once, learning to let go (still working on it)
- Show my travel history as well
