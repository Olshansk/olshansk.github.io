Being diagnost with ADHD requiers filling out a questionaire that is reviewed by a physician.

That's fine, and necessary, but it's not the real test.

The real test is to simply try ADHD medication; Vyvanse, Adderall, etc.

If you don't have ADHD, you'll feel like you're on methamphetamines. You'll be hyperactive, irritable, and unable to sleep. You'll want it to end.

If you do have ADHD, you'll enter a state of euphoria. The whole world will come together instead of feeling like it's a mess being pulled in a million directions. You'll be able to focus. The world will slow down. Your brain will be clear. You'll be less irritable. You'll be in the zone.

We need physicians to review things in today's day and age, but the real test is trial and error.
