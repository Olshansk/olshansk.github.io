Task:

1. **Product Founder Fit**: Building domain expertise is not hard, but entrenching oneself in the culture of an existing industry takes time.
2. **Patience:** Patience with results but impatience with action.
3. **Complimenting onself**: Kind of like relationships, I learnt a lot about myself. Marketing. Advertising. Selling. Domain expertise. Etc. My skillset is about ideation, strategic direction, execution, planning, organization, inspiration. I really have to get better at selling and building relatinoships.
4. **Managing emotional intelligence**: For myself and for others

This is a tl;dr and I really wish I had spent more time writing in the past.
