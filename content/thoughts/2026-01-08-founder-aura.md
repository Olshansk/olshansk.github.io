Ever since Paul Graham’s [Founder Mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html) came out, I’ve been trying to find a definition for another term I’ve been thinking about: **Founder Aura**.

Yesterday, I was speaking with a friend of mine. I’ll keep names and companies vague to maintain anonymity.

He’s a high-caliber researcher at one of the world’s leading companies. A well-known engineering leader and executive joined the meeting.

My friend felt the need to mention it. He felt the need to say that the executive appreciated his thoughts and ideas. He felt the need to say that the executive is “just like us.”

But even though the executive is far removed from the problem, we still appreciate and respect their input more.

In part, it’s because they have historical context, experience, perspective, and a proven track record of success.

In other part, it’s because they have Founder Aura.

You don’t have to be the founder to have it (e.g. Satya Nadella), but there are very few cases where a non-founder does.

This isn’t just about authority or decision-making power. Any executive can do that. It’s about having your presence inspire the people around you.
