Ever since Paul Graham’s [Founder Mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html) came out, I’ve been trying to find a definition for another term I’ve been thinking about: **Founder Aura**.

Yesterday, I was speaking with a friend of mine. I’ll keep names and companies vague to maintain anonymity.

He’s a high-caliber researcher at one of the world’s leading companies. A well-known engineering founder, leader and executive joined the meeting.

My friend felt the need to mention it. He felt the need to say that the executive appreciated his thoughts and ideas. He felt the need to say that the executive was “just like us.”

But even though the executive was far removed from the problem, we still instinctively appreciated and respected their input more.

In part, that’s because they have historical context, experience, perspective, and a proven track record of decisions that worked.

In another part, it’s because they have Founder Aura.

You don’t have to be the founder to have it. Satya Nadella is a good example. But there are very few cases where a non-founder truly earns it.

**This isn’t about authority or decision-making power. Any executive can do that. It’s about presence. It’s about carrying enough accumulated judgment that people pause, listen, and recalibrate when you speak.**

Founder Aura isn’t something you can claim. It’s something other people grant, usually after watching your decisions compound over time.
