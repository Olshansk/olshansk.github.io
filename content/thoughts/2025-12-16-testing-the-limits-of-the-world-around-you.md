To be a successfull founder, there are many traits one needs to embody: adaptability, discipline, perseverance, grit, humility, curiosity, integrity, and the list goes on...

Some of these come innately, while others are learned. In most cases, even those that come innately need to be cultivated, strengthened, and refined.

One that I never had a problem with myself is shame. I get nervous, anxious and do care what people around me think, but I was always shameless growing up. I'd say or do silly things, and just have fun.

It did take me a while to learn how to be shameless without being rude or disrespectful. That required building self-awareness, which did not come innately.

[In this podcast about Lee Kuan Yew](https://olshansky.notion.site/Lee-Kuan-Yew-Video-Version-2ca676fd2df781d69b66e6282ebd1a2a), Ben Wilson has this quote:

> At Raffles College, he does extremely well. He kind of goofs off and doesn't pay much attention. He's a prankster. And I'll just highlight this, that if you want to find really great talent, look for the pranksters. Thomas Edison was a prankster. Steve Jobs was a prankster. John Wooden was a great prankster. Alexander Hamilton was something of a prankster. The list goes on. It's a great way, for whatever reason, to spot talent. Very intelligent, very capable people. Know, I think what it is is they like to test the limits of the world around them and therefore they enjoy pranks.

In particular, I wanted to highlight the last sentence: **"They like to test the limits of the world around them and therefore they enjoy pranks."**

Whether it's rules, beliefs, practices, regulations, constraints, ideas, etc, I've never care about the status quo. If you have no shame, there's nothing to block your curiosity and push the world around you to its limits. If you're willing to live with the consequences of breaking a rule, do it, and you might uncover that the rule was not as important as you thought.

Being a prankster requires risk. Entrepreneurs have a higher risk tolerance. It's why they push the limits of the world around them. To change, you need stress. To change the world, you need to test its limits, then break them, and rebuild them.s
