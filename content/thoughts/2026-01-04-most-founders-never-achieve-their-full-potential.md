I had a conversation with my friend recently, and I brought up the fact that my mission is to enable everyon eo achieve their full potential, starting with myself.

I said that founders are the ones who are closest to doing this. He called me out and said "You're wrong."

## Who did not achieve their full potential

**Bill Gates** - There's a reason he doesn't hold any microsoft stock, and it's not just diversification. He was burnt by being challenged.

**Martha Stewart** - I highly recommend her documentary if you haven't already seen it. She is smart, original, ruthless and the world fucked her over at her prime because of some trading scam. Regardless of whether or not it was true, she had so much more in her.

**Elon Musk** - A lot of conflicting opinions here, but I personally believe that he chnaged the world in a way very few have. He's no longer at his prime, but is playing a different game today. Years of stress, drugs and pressure have taken their toll on him, mentally, emotionally and physically.

**Albert Einstein** - The war got in the way.

**Steve Jobs** - He died way too young
