**Money Magnifies You. AI Amplifies Your Intelligence.**

---

There’s a common saying:

> Money doesn’t change who you are; it magnifies who you really are.

AI works the same way:

> AI doesn’t change your intelligence; it amplifies your intelligence.

When you see both as tools to expand who you are rather than define you,
the whole picture snaps into place.

Financial freedom removes capital as a ceiling on curiosity.
AI removes time and access to information as ceilings on curiosity.

Money lets you explore further.
AI lets you explore faster.
Curiosity does the rest.
