A lot has been changing at work recently, so I've been putting some thought into employee equity from the perspective of the employee and the employer.

There are some arrangements that are better for the employer, some that are better for the employee, but I don't think there's one that maximizes the best for both.

Here is what I personally had first hand experience with:

- **Twitter**: RSUs in a public company.
- **Magic Leap**: Options in a private company that I never exercised. They went to nearly zero after a recapitalization
- **Waymo**:
- **Grove**:

The following is not an exhaustive comparison, but a simplification for the purposes of this post. For example, I'm intentionally not taking taxes into account for the purpose of simplicity.

- **Best for employees, worst for employers**: Grant RSUs RSUs in a public company.
- **Best for employers, worst for employees**: Options in a private company that I never exercised. They went to nearly zero after a recapitalization

- RSUs instead of options
- Account for pivots
- No money for options
- Protect the employer
- Force rebuy
- Give the employee something instead of nothing or instead of the most
