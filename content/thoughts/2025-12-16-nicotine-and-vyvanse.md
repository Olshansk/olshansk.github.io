I haven't missed a morning workout in almost a decade.

Sometimes it's a just stretch, sometimes it's at the airport, but there's always something.

A lot of people see it as discpline, but it's just an addiction.

Recently, I've been having conversations with a lot of founders, and we talk about how we were all "diagnosed" with ADHD as adults, and how helpful Vyvanse is.

Some people ask: "How do you know if you have ADHD?" The cognitive questionaires that doctors use are fine, but the real test is to take some Vyvanse.

One of two things will happen:

- **You have ADHD**: The whole world slows down, clears up, and the clutter in your mind fades away. You are calm, less restless, less irritable, less easily distracted, less easily overwhelmed, more productive, more creative, more energy, nicer to people
- **You don't have ADHD**: You feel like you're on methamphetamines.

I've noticed that Nicotine has a very similar, but much more short-lived, effect.

I like coffee, but I drink it for the taste, it does nothing.

Another misconception about ADHD is that you can focus. That is incorrect. It is hard to acquire focus, but once you do, you enter hyperfocus. It's why people with ADHD get cranky when you pull them out of their flow.

This has made me reflect that a lot of my patterns throuhout life have never been habits or acts of discipline. They're all just results of having an addictive personality, driven but short or long term obsession.

Is this related to having ADHD? Is it a result of being slightly on the spectrum? Is it just my personality? Is this the personality that entrepenrurs need? As with everything, it's a balance of everything.
