This movie was absolutely amazing in every single way.

- The graphics and action sequences felt unique and perfect for the big screen.

- The chemistry between the characters couldn't have been better. It's funny to think that half of the main cast was the same as "Crazy Rich Asians." :)

- The comedic relief was funny and helpful to the plot, without being neither cringy nor excessive.

- Even though the plot was relatively simple and straightforward, it had original aspects which did not make it seem too boring in the traditional sense.

- It felt both heart warming, relaxing but also invigorating at the same time. I love Tai Chi aspects combined with magical creatures, and magical powers.

The best part is that my sister and I had to run from the theatre to the car after the film because it was pouring outside. We ended up yelling at the top of our lungs, embracing the whole situation, and really extended the film's ambiance even after leaving the theatre :)
