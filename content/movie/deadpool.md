Finally, a funny and cathartic superhero movie that addresses all of my pet peeves, and one that I don't have to take too seriously. I get the satisfaction of awesome CGed fighting scenes, without all the cliche shit of "being a bigger man" and "doing the right thing." The film is funny, hot, raw and extremely entertaining.
