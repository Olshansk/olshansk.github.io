I absolutely LOVED the cast! Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Alison Brie, Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) , Jesse Plemnos (Game Night, Black Mirror etc...), Zach Woods (Silicon Valley), Carrie Coo-n (The leftovers), etc... As someone who doesn't recognize too many actors, this one was filled with a ton of actors I love.

The plot was based on a true story, and mainly revolved around the events of one evening, but was still extremely captivating. It was interesting, fun, thrilling, exciting and educational.

My favorite part about this film is the manner in which I watched it. I watched it with my family in two parts (1 hour each) over a span of two nights. On the second day, my family and I went on a small day trip to Niagra Falls which is about a 2 hour drive away. We like to listen to podcasts, interviews or audiobooks on long trips, so during the drive back we decided to listen to one of Vladimir Pozner's latest talks. By chance it was about the freedom of speech and the role of journalism in democracy. This fit in extremely well with the premise of the film as the two really complimented each other. The fact that we watched the film in two parts and listen to Pozner's talk in between could not have worked out any better. My view and respect on the importance of journalism has changed in ways I could have never expected. The full talk can be found here https://pozneronline.ru/2018/10/22988/.
