Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê

One of those movies that could have been much better than what it was.

I really wish this film came out better.

It was original. The premise was enticing. It had some satirical comedy. It was a bit dark.
It had Paul Rudd, which I'm personally a big fan of. It had all the ingredients for success.

Unfortunately, it wasn't. The graphics felt underbudget. The film felt like it was rushed.
As good as Paul Rudd is, he can't carry a bad cast.

Overall, it has potential, but the execution was subpar. If you're on something and want to
pass the time, it might not be a bad choice though.
