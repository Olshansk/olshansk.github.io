I didn't love it, but it's hard to hate a time travel film. Subpar acting with
a cool idea and a lovely ending make it worth the watch.

I loved how the film really portrayed the changing dynamics of gender over the
last 50 years without feeling neither misogynistic, sexist or feminist.

Even though the acting was slow and tier 2-ish, I got really invested in the two
main characters and the journey of their emotions.

I'm no going to spoil it, but I absolutely loved the last 10 minutes. Hats off
to the directors and writers for a well-crafted ending.
