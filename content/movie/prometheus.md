Though its common for movies of this genre to have unanswered questions towards the end, here they conflict with the actual plot as opposed to just having the viewer ponder in mystery. There was also little reason to most of the characters in this movie and while they were indeed present, their depth was as flat as the main message this movie tried to bring across. However, a beautiful movie film seen from a creative point of view is worth a watch regardless.
