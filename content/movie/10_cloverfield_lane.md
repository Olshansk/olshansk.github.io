Very interesting film.

Even though I saw Cloverfield when it first came out, I still found myself questioning whether this was a sequel to the same apocalyptic world where aliens invade earth; it's worth noting that I did not watch the trailer and simply assumed the two films were related because of the name and the fact that they are both bad robot productions.

Howard, a nice, psychotic, trained, prepared and absurd individual really made me feal uneasy throughout the whole thing. I really did feel like I was in Michelle's shoes, which was probably the point.

The sequence of events was extremely realistic and never farfetched; except for perhaps the liquor bomb at the very end.

I'm really excited to see what's next for Michelle, but more importantly, I think this film proved that Cloverfield is a brand that'll stay with us for quite a while. There have been so many films over the years that address alien invasion, but Cloverfield takes away the cliches and only leaves behind the raw aspects of survival, which differ greatly between every set of individuals. There could be dozens of different films revolving around the same set of events, and being one grander plot, we might see a lot of interesting overlap between the various storylines. Lots of opportunities for discussion and fanboism.
