I went to watch this movie because of Ryan Gosling. While I'm not Emma Stone's biggest fan, I love and admire her acting ability. As a lover of musicals, I was very pleasantly surprised 1 minute into the movie when I found out it was also a musical! The music was great, the story was lovely and the camera angles and transitions were both fun and original. 

I don't think my review can do the movie justice because the number of golden globe awards it's winning (as I'm writing this), and the review by Chris Hartwell (in The Hart Beat) speaks for itself.

The reason for the missing star is because the dancing and singing of the two main actors was good but not exactly "broadway" level. Their chemistry, however, more than compensated where they lacked in theatrical skills.
