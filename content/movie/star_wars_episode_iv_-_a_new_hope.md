While this movie did age very well, and watching it has been long overdue, I can't say it impressed me by today's standards. In a class good vs evil conflict, a few unrelated characters emerge, settle their differences, and kill of the bad guys. Throw in some comic relief, a hint of romance, and you've got yourself a film. There was very little background or development to any of the characters, and it was just a very superficial film devoid of any real feeling or emotion. That being said, I presume it must have been revolutionary when it came out.
