I was looking for a fun and nostalgic Disney movie to watch, but this far exceeded all my expectations. It was a stunning performance by Emma Stone, supported by a very strong cast, and I'm glad it was not just a live action remake of 101 Dalmatians.

The film managed to have true character development without taking itself too seriously. The visual effects were stunning and realistic, and it all somehow managed to come together very well.
