It's hard for me to rate this movie anything less than a 4/5 being the huge Chloe Grace Moretz fan I am. It was great to see her in action, taking a lead on the big screen again. In my opinion, she carried the movie. It was nothing short of another Maze Runner / Hunger Games type movie targeted at teens in dystopian end-of-the-world type situations, but Chloe's great acting, narration and fighting skills are all I needed to be satisfied.
