AI? Tech? Billionaires? Steve Carell? HBO Max?

Looking at the above, this movie felt like it was meant for me.

The first 20 minutes feel like a Silicon Valley special that we've all been waiting for.

I started picking real world entrepreneurs to associate with each character. Jeff was
Dario Amodei, Venis is Sam Altman, and I didn't pick anyone in particular for the others.

From there, it's just a slow and painful decline...

They had a lot of potential to make it funny. The pieces and ingredients were in place,
but somehow it just didn't happen.

It's hard to explain, but very unfortunate.

If you're deep in the field, it'll feel so cathartic that it may be worth watching.
For others, it may be a bit of a letdown.

It's the first time HBO has let me down in a while.
