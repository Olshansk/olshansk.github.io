A thrilling and suspenseful thriller that looks really good but filled with bad characters. The characters that are good at times so cliche that it makes the film cheesy. In order to fully enjoy this film and understand what seems to be the whole plot, one has to sign up to watch the whole series: Prometheus, Alien: Covenant, and whatever else is coming.
