The sort of film you go into with extremely high expectations, and it somehow manages to exceed all of them.

You thought Hugh Jackman's career as Wolverine was over? Well, I'm pretty sure he's going to keep going until he's literally dead.

You thought the multiverse thing was overdone? It is, but they managed to incorporate it into the film as a plot device
rather than the foundation.

It was entertaining, gory, cringey, funny, nostalgic and original all at the same time. I loved every minute of it.
