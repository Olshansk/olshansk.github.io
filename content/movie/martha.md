**To Martha**: In case you ever read this, I just wanted to say that you deserve
better. Thank you for agreeing to do the documentary. Mad respect. Would love
to visit your home for a brunch or dinner if the opportunity ever comes up. ✌️

I'm projecting, but will go ahead and say that if you're a late 80s or early 90s
millennial from the US, Martha Stewart is most likely one of three things:

1. The face of cooking shows and home decor
2. A person who broke the law and was sentenced to jail (don't even know why)
3. That old woman who hangs out with Snoop Dogg

After watching this film, my perception of Martha is, for the first time, actually
informed. More importantly, it has changed completely.

I used to think she was a sleazy woman, smoking drugs, breaking laws and using
home decor and cooking shows as a front.

Realistically, she is just a perfectionist, hard worker, blunt, honest, smart
woman who got extremely unlucky on a few occasions, treated unfairly by people
around her and targeted due to her reputation and wealth.

**Early life** - I never knew she gave wall street a shot. I was impressed that
she just came in and succeeded. She left not because things went south, but because
it was her first time hitting real failure as a hard working perfectionist. I can
relate, and it's something you learn to deal with in your 20s.

**Career** - It took her decades to build up her empire. What I admire is the fact
that she worked tirelessly, with urgency, but it was motivated by intrinsic
motivation, interest and curiosity. She always did it for herself.

**Communication** - Even in her 80s, she speaks bluntly, honestly, and directly. There's
no sugar coating, there's no bullshit, there's no disrespect. If something is stupid,
it's stupid. If something is pointless, it's pointless. If something is wrong, it's wrong.
If something is right, smart, admirable, inspiring, then she calls that out too.

_Why the fuck do people have a problem with this?_

**The Law Suit** - Whether or not there was insider trading, I honestly don't care.
She made the vast majority of her money not through trading, but through her business.
Whatever money she may have made or prevented losing through this "insider tip"
pales in comparison to what she made the right way. If she hadn't been targeted
as a way to "set an example", she would have built a deca-billion dollar empire.

_It really saddens me to know that whole ordeal is the reason it never happened..._

**Woke culture** - "Woke culture" really kicked around 2005 and only beginning
to taper off now in 2025. I think the alignment of the market, her age, career,
business maturity and a bunch of other elements just didn't align well. Sometimes
factors are just outside of our control.

**Snoop Dogg Era** - I didn't know this started just because they were sitting
next to each other during the Justin Bieber roast. I personally remember that
event happening live and just assumed Martha was still relevant at the time.
Apparently it was her return to relevancy and I had no clue.

I don't have much to add other than the fact that Martha is a badass. In the
documentary, I could tell her mind is still sharp but her body is aging. If the
opportunity to meet her ever comes up, I'd take it in a heart beat.
