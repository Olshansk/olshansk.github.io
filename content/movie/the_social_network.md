I remember watching this movie in 2010 when it just came out, and I just rewatched it in 2022 during its last month of Netflix. It is fascinating how much time has passed, how things have changed.

1. When the movie came out Facebook was still cool to kids. Today, Gen Zs don't even sign up for Facebook and it is left for "that thing your grandparents use".

2. Mark Zuckerberg was a pretentious, ill-tempered CEO, and has turned into a global figure who is under scrutiny from everyone, and semi-regularly testifies in front of the US government. Though it is still debatable what his intentions are, he has matured a lot as an individual.

3. At the time the movie was filmed, Facebook was valued at $25B. Today, Zuckerberg himself is worth north of $100B and the Winklevoss are billionaires of their own accord through their early $BTC investment and the founding of Gemini.

4. Facebook has been renamed to Meta Platforms.

5. Justin Timberlake was only 27 when the movie was being filmed, and I'm 29 as of writing this review. I feel old...
