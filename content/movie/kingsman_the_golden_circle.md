Minus the origin story, this was more of the same as the first Kingsman film, which is exactly what I was looking for!

The fighting scenes are shot in a very original way and are extremely engaging. The directors are not afraid to kill of any primary characters. The cast grew even stronger with people like Elton John, Channing Tatum and one of the main characters from Narcos. The balance of humour, seriousness and ridiculousness is perfect. I've got absolutely no complaints and looking forward to the next film in the series!

Also, it's crazy to think that the main character played Elton John in Rocketman a couple of years later!
