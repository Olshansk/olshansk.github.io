Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

The dynamics between Teller and Simmons spiral out of control, but the story just remains too repetitive. The girlfriend subplot made the message loud and clear, but really just felt like a message. A car crash? Why not, that'll send another message. Though this is a really great film, it was a little underdeveloped.
