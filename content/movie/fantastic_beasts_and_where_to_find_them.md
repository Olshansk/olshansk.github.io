A great movie that any Harry Potter fan will want to see, but not a must for all the others.

I felt like I was engrossed back in the Harry Potter Universe. While wizardry and magic is not a new concept, the Harry Potter franchise managed to do it right, and I'm very excited about the fact that it's back. From the wistful wand, to the ominous music and the fantastic beats, there is some very magical about how these movies are made.

That being said, the plot was very basic and felt kind of pointless. It feels like the experience/universe is the destination, while the plot is just the medium that delivers it. This is the type of experience that is much better suited for virtual reality.

However, I do not want to take away from the strong cast. They were funny, interesting and did a very good job, though nothing oscar worthy.
