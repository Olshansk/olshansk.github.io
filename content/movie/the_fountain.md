A very simple and widely reiterated message of acceptance delivered in an original and authentic medium. The symbolism in this film is a little bit excessive and was poorly organized, but intriguing nonetheless. It leaves you in a state of thoughtfulness and reflection, which is a quality in feels I seek endlessly and adore.
