Though I'm sure this movie was over-dramatized in places, it was entertaining, nostalgic, and educational all at once.

I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to any of my friends.

The stretch from 2000 to 2007 really pulled me back. Watching it now, with a professional lens, helped me finally process what was happening back then, even though I was just a kid watching the world shift.

The innovator’s dilemma Mike Lazaridis faced was painfully real. If I ever get the chance, I’d love to know what was actually going through his mind during the iPhone reveal.

The downfall of such a huge company shows that nothing is ever too big to fail.

The movie is packed with great moments about nerd culture, team dynamics, selling, and the vibe shift of the late 90s and early 2000s. And it’s strangely comforting to see a time when telecom giants weren’t at the helm of technological innovation.
