Though I'm sure this movie was overdramatized in certain parts, it was entertaining, nostalgic and educational all at the same time.

I abosolutely loved it and would recommend to any of my friends.

The series of events between 2000 - 2007 really took me back as I was finally able to reflect on what was happening from a professional point of view, even though I was just a kid seeing the world change at the time.

The innovator's dillema encountered by Mike Lazaridis was so real. If I ever have the opportunity, I'd love to know what was actually going through his mind during the iPhone release.

The downfall of such a large company just show that nothing is ever too big to fail.

Tons of good stuff around nerding out, team culture, selling and just the vibe shift of the late 90s and early 2000s. It's nice to know that Telecoms are no longer at the help of technological innovation.
