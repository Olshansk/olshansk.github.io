Very weak. While I did not expect the second book of a trilogy to be the pinnacle of the plot or have zeal that'll exceed my expectations, I did have expectations. Great arial shots and fancy action scenes do not compensate for mediocre acting, and stagnant characters that just prolong the story line to increase box office revenues.
