A very entraining look into the rise and fall (and maybe risk again?) of WeWork. At times it was engaging, ridiculous, exciting and educational.

I wouldn't want to watch this film in a theatre, but watching it with my roommate at home and pausing every 5 minutes to discuss or look things up was a great Friday evening.
