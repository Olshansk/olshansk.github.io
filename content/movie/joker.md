I was simultaneously overcome with curiosity, empathy and fear. Drowned by the sea of emotions, coming in wave after wave knocked me senseless and left me disoriented. Like being in the sea, I loved every moment of it, but I was also glad when it was all over and I was back in my safe home.

This is one of the best films of the year. If Arthur Fleck doesn't mean best actor, it'll be a very dark joke.
