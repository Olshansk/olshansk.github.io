A great film for the guys out there when you're looking for something lighthearted and fun.

I probably would have found this a bit boring or cringey if I had watched it in my 20s, but as
a single male, aspiring father, entrepreneur early in his journey, in my 30s, this was perfect.

How the directors portrayed the CEO in his 20s was on point. The level of woke-ness
of the company was cathartic but necessary, and masterfully not overdone.

The part in the beginning where Bill talks about why he got started late in life
was very relatable. Simultaneously, the part at the end where he thanks the stranger
on the bike but actually gives no shit was also very relatable. The fact that his
wife appreciated BOTH of those aspects is something I'm looking in a partner myself.

Aside from all the serious reflection stuff, I had two other favorite moments that literally made me LOL:

1. The entire "Hella Mike" scene
2. The scene at the end related to the "No cap" handshake
