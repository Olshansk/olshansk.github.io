While this film does not capture everything Jobs was, nor everything he had done, it manages to sum up and deliver what was the core of his essence and his drive. While I can't speak for the historic accuracy, and one cannot expect the film to detail everything the book had, this film is nonetheless interesting, entertaining, and nonetheless inspiring!
