Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

This film was too true to real life, especially when you have a 17 year old sister....

The acting was phenomenal. I loved the role the character and role that the teacher played. It brings across the point that shit happens, things change, and you just need to move on. This message was delivered through such a realistic story that I was astounded it was just a film.
