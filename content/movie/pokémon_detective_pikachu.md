A cliche movie, trying to do to much in too little time, but is still worth watching because POKEMON!

The movie set up a bunch of different subplots, background stories, and characters, but everything just went way too fast and was way too short. We were introduced to the main character's best friend in the beginning and then never saw him again. There were only 2 minutes of self-reflection throughout the whole film. The main actor meets his dad, and then they become best friends all of a sudden culminating in a happy ending. This is all super cliche, but was some

All that matters is that the pokemon looked frickin awesome.
