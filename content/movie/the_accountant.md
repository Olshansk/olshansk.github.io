Thrilling original characters, supported by a strong cast, which is tip-toeing on the balance of how much the viewer can accept as not too far fetched. The film includes a brilliant mind, good old school karate chops, a family quarrel, tons of cache and a mild romance. Thought it might sound cheesy, Ben Affleck manages to make it seem real.
