A really cool fantasy, in a good setting with an intriguing plot. However, the plain cinematography and lack of character development left hungry for more.

The "monster" and Elisa were alone at the start and that's how they ended. Each character had a role to play, and they simply acted out the steps. Overall, it lacked the level of depth and thought that I was expecting from an oscar winner.
