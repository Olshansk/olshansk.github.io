A timeless classic.

An extremely strong cast (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Robin Williams just to name a few) who create world of compassion, affection and such candid emotion that it feels unreal. There were points when I just wanted to jump in and give the characters a hug myself.

The plot was perfect. There are films where the protagonist's dark background or the or the parallel love story are superfluous, and were added out of sheer necessaity to meet a film's equivalent of the "Hamburger model". However, every scene in this film had a very good reason for being part of the film, and every character had a reason for being there, regardless of how major or minor.

If it were possible, I'd give this film more than 5 stars.
