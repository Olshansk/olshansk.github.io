As an Adam Sandler fan, I was extremely disappointed by this film.

There was no plot, no character development, and really no point.

It felt like the whole film was mindlessly jumping from one scene to the next. I could see how the director aimed to depict what was going through the main character's mind, but if it's not interesting or enticing, it's a waste of time.
