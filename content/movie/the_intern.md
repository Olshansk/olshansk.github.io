Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

An earnest and gentle film that's very pleasant to watch. It reminds you that regardless of how overwhelming life may sometimes be, it's important to take a step back and appreciate both the people and things around you. It's the type of film that makes you feel so warm inside, that you just want to go out and cheer up anyone who is feeling down.

With De Niro and Hathaway in lead roles, I have nothing but good things to say about this movie. I absolutely loved it!
