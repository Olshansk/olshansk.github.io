A passionate performance by Zac Efron in a very endearing film that plays by the rules but dares to go beyond traditional expectations.

A great film to watch when you want to sit back and relax. Very fun, very entertaining, along with a soundtrack that resonates with your pulse. It's very true to the reality that many millennials are facing, and does a great job at depicting individual's dreams.
