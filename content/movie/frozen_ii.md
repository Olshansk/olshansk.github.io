Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

A great feel-good movie that should be on everyone's list though it is not as iconic as the first one.

Original music with great animation were supplemented by hilarious comic relief from Olaf and Kristoff. Though the second half of the movie was pretty by the book, but the first half reminded me of how I felt after first watching Shrek with two hilarious moments standing out:

1. Kristoff's 90s boy band pop music song.
2. Olaf hilariously introducing the character of Samantha.
