Rating: ⭐

Would've been an okay "waste" of time if it were 1.5 hours, but 2.5 hours was way too long. The film was neither too funny nor dramatic. The cast was okay but not great. The plot had potential but wasn't intriguing. There wasn't a single particular bad thing that stood out but it was just a very long film for something that felt like it had no point, lesson, feeling or mood.
