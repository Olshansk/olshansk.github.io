This movie is the epidemy of real life and reminds me of a story that could be written by Haruki Murakami. The realism and simplicity is what makes it so great. Romantic but readable. Awkward but relatable. Entertaining but slightly cringy. 

Full of awkward conversations and meaningless moments. Many situations where tipping or giving money is mandatory, but the lack of intention along with the obligation just makes it feel true. The awkward sexual tension that's discussed twenty times throughout the day, and is as far from perfect as possible.

This film did absolutely everything right.
