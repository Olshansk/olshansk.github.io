In a politically correct world where everyone seems to be overly sensitive to the slightest jokes, I'm glad we have films like this.

The film is funny, gory (but not unnecessarily), cliche in just the right ways, remains true to itself and breaks the 4th wall in a very well written way. In my opinion, the writers of deadpool don't nearly get enough credit!
