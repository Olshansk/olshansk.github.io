Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Classic Nicolas Cage in a role designed specifically for him, in a plot that's
engaging and traumatizing at the same time.

I didn't love the film, but I couldn't stop watching it. Classic Nicolas Cage at his best.

If you're in the mood for an original plot, about the up and downsides of dreams,
fame and being careful of what you asked for, this is a good choice.

Though it's not a masterpiece, I can't stop thinking about it.
