Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

One of the best feel-good holiday-season rom-com chick-flicks. A must watch for everyone :)

## 12/30/2023 Update

Re-watched it with the whole family (mom, dad and sister) and it's still a great film.
The humility that an early 2000s movie makes it feel real, authentic, relatable and
doesn't feel like it's trying to aim for high box-office returns.

I also have to say that whoever put together the cast had a great eye for talent.
