Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The film was off to a very good start, but kind of lost track and meaning as some characters went crazy and the plot divulged into many different threads.

Deckard is a replicant, we get it.

This film must have been impressive for its day, but it did not stand the test of time in the age of Westworld.
