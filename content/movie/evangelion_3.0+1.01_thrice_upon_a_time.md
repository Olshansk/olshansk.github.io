The first three movies in the series were exciting, interesting and unique at every single step along the way. This last film, for lack of a better word, was simply INSANE!

I have know idea what was going on half the time or what to believe in, but was in constant awe and endless though.

I feel that there was a lot of religious symbolism that flew over my head, but I do plan to rewatch it after watching the documentary and doing some reading to get better context of all the different elements. The animations, character development, storyline were amazing.

Everything about this film was mind blowing in a way I can't put into words.
