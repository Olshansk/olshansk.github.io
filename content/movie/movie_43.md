Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

I really think this movie is underrated. It's weird and stupid as hell, but it's frikkin hilarious!

It has a great cast, an original plot(s), and is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Sometimes I couldn't even believe people came up wit this type of shit.

My suggestion is too watch this film when you're a little inebriated ;)
