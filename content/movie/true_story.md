A madman and a fanatic meet and entangle their lives in a web of lies, truths, stories, experiences and alliteration. Jonah Hill and James Franco never disappoint as they really carry the lives and memories or the roles they play, but the story they enacted was weak and was missing a strand of empathy that the viewer could hang onto.
