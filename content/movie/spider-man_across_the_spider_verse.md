One of my all-time favorite movies.

This film had it all: plot, character development, romance, graphics, originality, suspense, comedy and fun in all the right does and balance out perfectly.

Graphics - I watched it in theatres on my 31st birthday, and the only thing that compares (unsurprisingly) is the first film in the series. The tad bit of 🍄 definitely helped heighten my senses a bit, but that was just a bonus. Every seen was different, unique and had so much going on. Sometimes I would just pay attention to the walls and you don't even realize that the paint is flowing down to represent the flow of emotions.

Romance - The relationship between Gwen and Miles almost made me cry. The scene where the two of them were sitting upside down next to each other wasn't only breathtaking visually, but also breathtaking emotionally. I felt like I was there with them. I felt the love between them. It was real.

Character Development - 🕷️👨 is an ⬇️🐕 story, but when you have spider-man fighting all the other spider-man, that's the true ⬇️⬇️⬇️🐕. It was amazing.

Plot - The film was 2.5 hours in length and ended with a "to be continued...". Any film that does this know they made a great movie and are confident there will be another. They know they killed it and didn't have to rush to start and end the story in 2.5 hours, so it's essentially turning to be the same length as a short Netflix mini-series. They set an extremely high bar, and more of the same is the best they can do. I already can't wait for the next one.
