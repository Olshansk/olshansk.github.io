Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

A movie with a very interesting and unique premise. The full potential of this movie definitely was not realized, but it was nonetheless fun, entertaining and felt very genuine. Adam Sandler did a great job, showing he could do more than just basic comedy.

I think the low ratings are very likely a result of herd mentality and many Adam Sandler haters, whoa re just going to hate.
