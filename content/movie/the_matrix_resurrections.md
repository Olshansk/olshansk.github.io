Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

The film did a very good job at appealing to its original fanbase, but similar to how the second and third films in the trilogy were nothing compared to the iconic original, this wasn't any different.

It passed the time, felt cathartic, is worth a watch with some friends when you want to have some fond memories from 20 years ago, but it was nothing spectacular.
