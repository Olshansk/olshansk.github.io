Can't say it's a must-watch, but if you enjoyed the Harry Potter films growing up, there's no reason you shouldn't watch this one either.

The documentary is a play on your nostalgia and emotions. It brings you back into the magical world of Harry Potter & Hogwarts we all learnt to love growing up. It's hard for me to say how attached one would be to the whole world if they didn't read the books or watch the films as they were coming out, but I did!

I never knew how frequently they changed the directors, and understand why each movie felt so different. I also didn't know how many different permutations of Harry, Ron and Heromonie they went through before finding the perfect cast!

I've spent a lot of time thinking about whether Harry Potter would get a remake one day. Even though it could from a graphics perspective, there is no way to replace the magic (no pun intended) of the cast's chemistry. We saw them grow up as people, as characters, as actors and as friends. The whole world was engulfed in a new story that was realizing itself as JK rowling kept writing.

The reason we, the audience, were as emotional watching the film as the cast is that similar to how the actors know it was a once in a lifetime experience to grow up together, we know that we grew up with them, and will never be able to relive those years, but only reminisce.
