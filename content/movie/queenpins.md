I've been on a "light-hearted" movie kick lately, and Queenpins is was a great addition
to the set. It's easy watch, entertaining, funny, but also surpsinginly informative.
It even scratched the business-nerve in me and I didn't even see it coming.

It's crazy how much of this story is based on [real facts](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robin-ramirez-amiko-fountain-marilyn-johnson-40-million-counterfeit-coupons_n_1690095).
The police recovered $40MM of counterfeit coupons. Tthe more entertaining bit
is that they did actually use boats, guns and cars to "clean" the "dirty money".
Apparently the police seized cars worth $240,000, 22 guns and a 40-foot speed boat.

It was great to see Joel from Community, but he felt very underutilized as Connie's
husband. I'd go so far as saying that his acting in this film was bad...

Paul Walter Hauser, playing Ken (the fat coupon guy) was phenomenal. Hilarious, cringey,
charming in his own weird way. Couldn't have asked for more from a comedic relief
character. I believe it was Vince Vaughan's performance that really created a platform
for him to let that character shine.

Overall, definitely worth watching for almost everyone when you're in the mood for
a light-hearted movie, based on a true story, with a few surprising twists.
