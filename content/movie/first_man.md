Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Another film where Ryan Gosling shows his acting versatility. The film provides an insight into Neil Armstrong's life that I hadn't known. His monumental step on the moon was already depicted as an adventurous, heroic and exciting. It was scary and dangerous for obvious reasons, but the film provides a fresh insight into the struggles he had to endure.
