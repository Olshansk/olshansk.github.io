As stupid as this is going to sound, I think it's the best way to describe this film: A movie from the hood meant for white people. It had a lot of fun and quirky elements, intertwined through a pretty dark central plot. The cast and acting is great and very appropriate for the film. At times, I was impressed by how varied the filming styles were between the different scenes. There were interesting "rewind" elements, and the protagonist unexpectedly broke the 4th dimension at some point. Another interesting factor was how brightly lit all the scenes were, even when the mood was darkened. Definitely worth a watch.
