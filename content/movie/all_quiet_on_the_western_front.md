A tantalizing film that simultaneously felt real and fearful. I knew exactly what every individual was going through, from moments of fear to happiness, relief and mania. Being drawn in and out of reality, sometimes numb to what's around you, while hanging on to the short-lived moments of glimmer. The unfounded nationalism of war by children and their seniors knowing their chances are slim. The soldiers fight in the dirt, while the politicians negotiate alongside freshly baked croissants. The film made me feel for what was, and appreciate what is.
