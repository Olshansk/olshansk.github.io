I started watching it because I felt obligated to, but I finished watching it because it was hi-la-rio-us.

It's mindblowing as to how well this film has aged, and how it is still an extremely entertaining and original film for people of old ages in 2015. It is a masterpiece today, so I really can't comprehend how ahead of it's time it was when it first came out.

MUST MUST MUST WATCH!
