Right place. Right Time. Right Circumstances.

The film delivers a ticket to a timeless lesson delivered in the least cringy way possible by a Rom Com.

A classic heart-warming RomCom that exceeded all of my expectations by having a
lovely cast led by George Clooney and Julia Roberts.

It's funny. It's real. It's silly. It has a great cast. It's no masterpiece, but
it's filled with surprised and totally worth watching.
