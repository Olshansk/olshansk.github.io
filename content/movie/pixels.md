I watched this movie over three different sessions, and was in no rush to get back to it. Three actors I love, a really hot chick, a silly situation and really cheesy phrase makes for a mediocre past time but not a great film. The graphics were pretty cool and original but the premise of the movie just was not up too par. Granted, I think this is targeted at kids, much younger than myself,
