A great movie that depicts a historical event very accurately. The cast was very strong and well selected. All the actors did a great job at fitting and playing their roles. My only issue is that it feels like it was cut a little short. However, seeing how that's my lack of satisfaction with the historical accounts rather than the film itself, I can't really complain.
