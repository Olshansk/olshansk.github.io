I was very surprised that as an avid movie watcher I missed out on one of these instant classics over all these years.  Primal fear is a movie that stands the test of time, like many other Edward Norton films. I was puzzled, confused and kept questioning myself throughout the whole film rather than just sitting back and relaxing, and was astonished by how events culminated.

Definitely a must watch.
