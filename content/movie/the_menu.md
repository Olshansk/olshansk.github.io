The Menu is reminiscent of "The Bear" if you were to give it a dark twist and
some thrilling suspense.

Some movies are entertaining, some are thrilling, some are fun, some are heart-warming,
some are thought-provoking, some leave an impression, but this one is the definition
of original.

I had no clue where things were progressing, what twists to expect, what backstories
the characters would have and loved every moment of it. It reminded me of "The Cabin"
from many years ago, but with more sophisticated and with class.

This is definitely the sort of thing I'd recommend to others.

A couple moments that stuck out are:

- The monologue about "not eating" was something I'll never forget
- The entire cheesburger subplot was masterfully done and executed
