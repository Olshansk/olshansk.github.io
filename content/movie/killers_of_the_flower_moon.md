Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This film required 3 sittings to watch. It was good, informative, well directed,
but would have been nothing without Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro.

The story was one worth telling, but nothing stood out. The actors were okay, the
cast was okay, the story was okay, the filmography was okay. It was all okay.

Leo and De Niro, as always, killed it as actors. They managed to depict the personalities
of real individuals who were greedy, but also honest and confused. They carried the
entire film and the rest of the cast kind of just revolved around them.

I can't say it's a must watch, but if you want to see a couple of masters practicing
their craft, this is one way to do it.
