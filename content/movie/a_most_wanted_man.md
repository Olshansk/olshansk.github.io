Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

A most wanted man shows that less is more. For a 2 hour long film, there weren't that many action scenes, and I would say that the dialog was kept to a minimum. It is the sense of fear and threat, accompanies by the ambient realism that made it what it was. No tricks, no fancy explosions, no unnecessary suspense, but just the view of a bystander looking at a most wanted man.
