One should watch all Pixar movies at one point or another, but this one will not be memorable.

I love Pixar films. The music, the characters, the feels, the plot. Movies like Ratatouille, Up or Wall-E are entertaining for both young and old, make you see the world from a new perspective, and dig deep into your heart.

Onwards was beautiful and fun, but felt way too cheesy and "unrealistic" in the sense that it just didn't make too much sense. It had a lot of potential and great setup, but simply felt like it tried too hard.
