I watched this Netflix special over the course of a few nights instead of doom
scrolling Instagram before bed. I have to say that choosing standup over instagram
is a pretty good middle ground when I'm not in the mood for TV, but still need
to turn off my brain before bed.

The best part about this special weren't just the jokes, but the balance of Andrew's
charisma, kindness and politically incorrect jokes as he exuded both comedy
and a heart-felt emotion off stage.

He smoothly transitioned from talking about stroking his penis to love his daughter
in what some would call awkward, but I see as mastery. It's all the things we call: Life.

**Overall**: it was a carefully crafted jambalaya of political incorrectness, social
awkwardness, a sensitive topic most men are afraid to talk about, interjected with
moments of love and appreciation.

**Sperm donation**: It's ironic that s a regular sperm donor myself, none of this
was weird to me at all! In fact, I've gotten very comfortable with small talk and eye contact on my way in and out (pun intended) of the sperm donation clinic. I have a
few of my personal stories which are on par with what Andrew discussed, but I'll
definitely have to practice the story and the delivery. #NormalizeSpermDonation

**Politically incorrect Jokes**: The political regime always sways back and forth
and I'm super happy that we can make fun of everyone again. Be it Jews, Mexicans,
New Yorkers, etc... It's become "okay again" and I love every moment.

**Andrew Schultz**: What led me to watch this episode is listening to Andrew on
two separate podcasts: Modern Wisdom and the All-In Podcast. There was some overlap,
but the combination of all three gave me a 360 view of him, and my impression is that
he's genuine, hard-working, has a ton of grit, resilience, is truly kind and loves
his family.
