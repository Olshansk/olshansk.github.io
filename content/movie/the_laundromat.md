Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

Not at all what I had expected, but it fascinated me and exceeded my expectations in the weirdest of ways.

You'll learn something new, you'll be entertained, you'll be kind of creeped out and confused at times, but overall, you'll be happy that you set through the film. 

It is a mockumentary type version of The Big Short, with a much lower budget. I can't tell if the film was made out of haste, or passion, or interest, but I never wanted to take my eyes off even though I can't say that I loved it.
