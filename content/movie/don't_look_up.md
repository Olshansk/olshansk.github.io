Absolutely amazing!

I'm not really sure where to start. The top-notch cast? The satirical comedy? How true everything is to reality? The CGI? The parallels it draws with the real world? The casual romance? The sad truth of what's happening in the world? Everything about this film was absolutely amazing.

I haven't been able to stop thinking about this film since I watched it and neither can my family. If a similar end-of-the-world type scenario were to take place in the real world, I think it would play out in the exact same way: you get dismissed, you go to social media, the world gets divided, fun and crazy things happen, and ultimately the truth comes out.

As much as I am a fan of the Steve Jobs meets Elon Musk character and was personally excited by BASH's initiatives, I really like that there wasn't a "happy ending" since it served as a wake-up call for what's happening in the world today.

If we don't take action now, literally right now, it'll be too late.
