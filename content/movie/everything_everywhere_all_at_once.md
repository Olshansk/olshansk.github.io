Exceeded absolutely every expectation I could have had, and I went in with none going in.

The film is high-paced, entertaining, original in more ways than one and a cast with more chemistry than I expected.

The lessons and meaning provided by the screenplay are timeless, as the film is itself. More importantly, it was delivered in a way that's funny but not cheesy whatsoever.

It also reminded me of a lesser-known film called "Mr Nobody" from 2009.
