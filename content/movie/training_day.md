Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

Two fantastic actors acting out the sad reality of corruption. This film felt real, raw, creating a ton of suspense and having the perfect amount of character development. It was paced impeccably well and had the perfect balance of comedic relief, blood-filled scenes, and basic conversation.
