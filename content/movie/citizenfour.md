It is amazing that the footage shown in this film is amazing. You can watch the events surrounding the NSA and Snowden unfold as they were happening; barely cut or unedited. However, there is very little this film taught me that I did not already know, and there are a lot of missing pieces both before and after the immediate events surrounding Snowden. Aside from delivering Snowden's fascinating calmness and and well contained composure, this film felt very empty.
