One word: revolutionary.

This film is one of the very unique cases where I wanted to give a movie more than 5 stars.

The story is a tad bit cliche (origin story, someone gets hurt, hero realizes their potential, climax, fight scene, happy ending, etc...), but even an overdone concept (multiple universes) still managed to feel original. It was engaging, funny, and entertaining all at the same time.

Most importantly, the art! It was extremely refreshing to see something unique. I have no words to describe how what I saw, but it was mesmerizing and unlike anything I've experienced before. I wish I had watched this movie in theatres.
