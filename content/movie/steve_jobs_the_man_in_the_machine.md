A lesson from history and a candid look into who steve jobs really was. The film does a great job at portraying Steve's identity in an unbiased manner through interviews of his family, friends and coworkers. Clips from the recent and distant past really show the mental hardships and conflicts he went through, as well as the impact he had on Apple and the tech sector as a whole.

I felt that he was never sure in what he was doing, and I can't say with confidence whether he was a good or bad man, but he was definitely a character from whom we can take away some lessons. While a lot of the achievements that are often associated with him were primarily the work of others, I would argue that he was a key catalyst in making it all happen, and for that, he has earned my respect.
