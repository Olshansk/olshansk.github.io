Watching this film during the war of 10/7 in 2023 was a lot to take in.

It feels like everything and nothing can change in the span of 50 years. The technology has improved, the war has moved on, but the mindset and conflict is the exact same.

Golda shows an inside view into someone who wanted to make a country better, but ended up giving all her energy to save her people. She was a leader, a parent, but I don't know how much of a mother someone like this could be. Her kids did not make an appearance in the film which is a good reminder that we must all make sacrifices.

It is a strong reminder that all leaders, no matter how confident they look on camera, struggle behind the scenes. They are human, and they are trying to do the best they can.
