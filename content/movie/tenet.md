10/5 The definition of a must-see.

Christopher Nolan never disappoints, and this film was a reminder of that. There are a few movies I end up watching more than once, but I'm already looking forward to seeing Tenet a second time. 

The movie devoured my entire focus causing 2.5 hours to fly by (or did they?), bent my brain in multiple directions, and opened my eyes to new ideas.
