Rating: ⭐⭐🌟

Mark Wahlberg put on a great poker face to really transcend the ambiance of a true gambler's life. However, all the other relationships and characters in the film felt rushed, incomplete, ephemeral. Though they were only introduced to support the main character, I would have been interested in seeing a more involved relationship. The film also failed to create the suspenseful atmosphere it so obviously aspired for because it was too easy to tell whether Jim was going to hit the jackpot or roll snake eyes.
