A surprisingly entertaining and funny film that takes such sharp turns you're continuously entertained and bemused throughout. With an amazing intro and very basic comedic first half to the movie, it's crazy how quickly things escalate. While some moments are intended to be sarcastic and overdone, it was impressive how well the realistic ones blended in.

A fantastic film to watch if you're in the mood for a comedy with a twist.
