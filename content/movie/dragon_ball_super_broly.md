This movie exceeded all of my expectations!

The back story was fantastic and answered so many questions I've always had. There were half a dozen moments where I would pose a question (while watching it with a friend), and 2 minutes later the film would answer it. This is hard for any film to do!

As expected, the plot was pretty straightforward, but the backstory accounted for it. More than half the film comprised of one large fight, but it went by extremely fast.

The animation was on point and one of the final fighting scenes was really reminiscent of "spiderman into the spider verse" with it's color scheme and movements. It was breathtaking and showed that the DB production team is really stepping up it's game.

It's worth mentioning that this movie picks up exactly where the first half of Dragon Ball Super stopped and the show will continue where this movie ended. This makes it the first DBZ movie that is part of cannon and maintains a coherent plot. I'm extremely happy the producers of DBZ are creating so much great content for the fans.

With all of that said, it is important to note that it does come with all the cheesy parts of anime, and if you're not a Dragon Ball fan it's not for you. However, if you are a DBZ fan, this movie is fantastic!
