Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

There are two reasons I watched this film:

1. It had Tom Hanks in it.
2. My mom read the book and loved it.

The first 30 minutes make it seem like a simple and boring story. In fact, I'm
sure Tom Hanks hates it when people compare his acting roles to Forrest Gump
because almost nothing compares.

But, the story is warm, heartwarming, powerful and the characters ar real.

The flashforwards and flashbacks are extremely well done. The balance of love,
suicide, comic relief, tragedy and the mundane day-to-day is unparalleled.

I don't think this film would succeed without Tom Hanks, but all the supporting
characters are what make it worth watching.

When you're in the mood for a heartfelt story, this is definitely a go-to.
