ABSOLUTELY MIND BLOWN! This film is a must watch, whether you like super heroes or not.

It has taken me a long time to get to this movie and I was blown away in every way. I didn't know that spiderman was just a temporary MCU character with all the history between Sony and Disney. I didn't know that the movie feature all the previous spidermans, and I had no idea how multi-verse like this film was going to be.
