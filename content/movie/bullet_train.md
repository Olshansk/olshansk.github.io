EEE: Exhilarating, Entertaining and Eccentric.

The amount of fun that Brad Pitt and the rest of the A-star cast had filming literally spills off the screen. It was dark, funny, action-filled, and kept surprising you around every corner.

The pace never slowed down and the amount of effort and originality was peaking at every moment. For example, I loved the 5 minute montage of The Wolf's life, just to have him be killed 2 mins later.

There was not a second in the film that where the producers or directors got lazy.

A frikking must watch.
