A candid recollection of Gorbachev's memories and opinions about the Soviet Union. He is one of the few people in the USSR who was legitimately kind-hearted, well-intentioned and wanted what's better for everyone, with or without communism.

Given all the horror stories I hear of Russian from my parents, and the current political landscape, the world is lucky that a man like this was given the option to lead a large state when it was an international "superpower".
