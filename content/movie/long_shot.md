Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Exceeded all of my expectations!

Not a film that'll win major awards, but it was extremely funny and entertaining. The concept was original, the chemistry between the two main characters was phenomenal, and it is a great film to watch when you just want to kick back, relax and feel-good.

There was a fine balance between seriousness, comic relief, and plain ridiculousness. The magnification of real-life events (i.e. having a stupid president) was very appropriate, and I'd definitely love to see Seth Rogen do more of these.
