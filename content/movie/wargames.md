Rating: ⭐⭐

Some games you can plan on and on forever, while others you forget about and never open again. I can see the appeal this film may have had when it first came out, but it definitely did not stand the test of time.

Cheesy acting, typical story, and doesn't contribute any thoughtful lessons a post cold-war era.

Would not recommend.
