This film tried to tackle an increasingly sensitive subject, and for that reason I believe it was critiqued more harshly than it should. Given the cast and the available funding, it definitely could have done more. However, it was unique and beautiful in it's own way, and while the movie itself was not transcendent, the thoughts and messages it transcribed were.
