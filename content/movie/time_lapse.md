Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Dark and dreary, yet also very thrilling as the unsettling events of the future unfold. A very original take on time travel, where a window into the future shows that not all that glitters is gold. The limited number of characters, and the minimal changes in setting give the film a very play-esque feel, proving that you don't need a huge budget and fancy CG when the underlying story is phenomenal.
