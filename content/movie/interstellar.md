Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Amazing! Suspenseful, emotional, exciting, surprising. A movie with a great message, a great plot, breathtaking graphics and a very interesting take on the aspects of science that are still a mystery to us. A great job by everyone in this film. Would not change a thing.

There aren't many movies I watch twice, and there aren't many movies that blow my mind, but this is it!
