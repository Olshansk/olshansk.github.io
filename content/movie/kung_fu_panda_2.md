I've been really craving a good feel-good animated film that is also interesting, but this did not fit the bill to the point where I didn't even finish it. It just felt empty and aiming to continue a profitable franchise rather than tell an original story with a great set of characters. 

I'm looking for something like WALL-E, but have yet to find it.
