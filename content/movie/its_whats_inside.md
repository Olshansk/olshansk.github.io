Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

An EXTREMELY original take on the body swap trope.

This has cult classic potential.

The plot is original and engaging. The execution and cinematography are exactly what's needed. The acting is solid, but was lacking JUST A BIT to make this an easy 5 stars.

I'd recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for a "body swap" movie with a few dark twists.

Might even be something I re-watch in the future.
