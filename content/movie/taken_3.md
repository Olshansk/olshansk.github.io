Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

While it still pales to the first film because the novelty of Bryan Mill's astounding character is wearing off, I've got to say that it's a step up from the second. Taken 3 gave me more of what I wanted and even managed to surprise me a couple times along the way. A high-paced escape sequence, followed by a lot of sadness and an obligatory threat, finished off by a rube goldberg-like plan that's bound to fail, all accompanied by frantic camera angle changes are all I was expecting, and all I had taken away.
