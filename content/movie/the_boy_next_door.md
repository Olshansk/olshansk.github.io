Rating: ⭐⭐🌟

The only reason I watched this movie is because I was interested in seeing Jennifer Lopez in action, and that's what I got. While the cast is not necessarily top of the line, I think it was very on par, and right along the lines of what you would expect. The film was dark, and surprisingly original thanks to the inordinate characters. Though it cannot compare to blockbusters with a list actors, it was entertaining, sexy, fun and a good "it's 2am and I want to watch a movie while paying little attention" kind of movie.
