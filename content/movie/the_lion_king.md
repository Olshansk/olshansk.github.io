A beautiful "national geographic" film that tries and fails to trigger the inner child and long-lasting connection many of us have had with the film. It definitely did not live up to the original.

The original animated film is a classic. A cliche story with great music, fun animations, and even brings a tear to your eye. 

However, the live action feel is way too close to reality. The animals look real, and it makes me feel uncomfortable to see them talk, sing and dance. The songs feel like they were cut short, the classic moments feel forced, and while it did pass the time, I cannot say that I enjoyed it.

There was no way to see emotion (a tear, a smile, etc...) on the faces of the real animals which really took away from the film.
