I don't have much to stay about the film other than the fact that it was "Okay" but was entertaining to watch because of the commentary my friends and I included along the way.

I don't know if there's TV trope for futuristic fantasy with middle-ages elements, but that's what this film is. They had bag pipes and ancient customs, combined with spaceships we can't even imagine.

Not the type of movie I'd particularly recommend to anyone else.
