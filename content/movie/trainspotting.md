Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

I thought this movie came out in the mid-200s, and was extremely surprised that's is from 1996, just showing how well it aged.

The actors in this film are, in my opinion, phenomenal! The hardships, the friendship, the pain, the happiness are felt extremely real and candid, almost as if the actors themselves had to go through the same circumstances in their own lives.

While the film does contain cliche "get the girl" or "get in a fight" like elements, it definitely breaks the traditional cookie cutter boundaries we are used to, and that's what makes it great.

Very graphic and disturbing at parts, but definitely worth a watch.
