An already childish easy to read book that appeals to the slightly older crowd via 80s pop culture references turned into a blockbuster that has nothing to showy or than millions in flashy graphics. 

The book had some interesting gaming concepts, insights, and really made you fear the dystopian virtual world. However, the film did nothing but maintain the original skeleton and did nothing that gave the story true life and emotion.

Other than some flashy graphics, I don't think this had much to offer.
