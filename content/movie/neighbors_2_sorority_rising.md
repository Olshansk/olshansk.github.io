This film had some of my favorite actors/celebs including Chloe, Selena, Seth and Zac. I very much enjoyed the first film. I often enjoy silly little films without a point just to have a laugh and feel good. Unfortunately, this film was just utterly pointless, not in the least beat funny, felt very fragmented and I couldn't handle how idiotically (though it was just acting) everyone acted.
