A good film that Disney can add to its repertoire, but won't have a grand impact on culture or filmmaking as a whole. 

It's a classic Disney storyline in the sense that there was a hero, with dream, who faced hardships along the way, *insert montage here*, gets an opportunity, meets a villain which the hero later befriends, loses hope while everything seems bleak, only  to have a happy ending where everything works out for everyone except for the bad guy who gets locked up behind bars.

These types or films are great, and shaped my character as I grew up (Mulan, Hercules, The Lion King, Aladin, etc...), but I think they're targeted at a younger audience whom they are trying to teach the basic lesson of never giving up. However, simple films like these sometimes manage to develop an emotional connection with the audience, which in my opinion did not happen here. I didn't tear up when Judy gave up her badge, nor did I experience triumph when she solved the case. I simply kept watching the movie.

Another great and beautiful film from Disney, but not one that'll pass the test of time.
