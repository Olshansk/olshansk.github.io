A partially comedic, partially dramatic action film that is a fun way to spend an evening if you're in the mood for this sort of thing. It obviously doesn't go very deep, and though the plot has original pieces to it, it is pretty simple.

Overall, a fun twist on groundhog day that won't stand the test of time (no pun intended) but is entertaining nonetheless.
