Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

An awesome feel-good movie with an extremely original plot twist that takes you down a path you don't expect. 

You can tell it's a low-budget film, like the Beatles' songs, but I truly believe it'll stand the test of time.

This song made me appreciate music as a language I'd love to master.
