Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

Though the film felt slow at some points, and though I did feel that  character depth was lacking in favour of the greater theme, it was still very captivating. There will be blood lives up to it's name up until the moment that it's finished, showing that there is no such thing as a resolution to a conflict between two people, but only a temporary compromise that two parties agree for as long as it benefits both of them.
