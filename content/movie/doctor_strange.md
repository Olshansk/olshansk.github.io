Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This film met my expectations exactly. It was another superhero film, so nothing too deep or strange about it. However, Cumberbatch's usual witty and funny persona really reminded me of Sherlock. A man of brilliance and with power that also helps the film feel light and not take itself too seriously, even when it does. The graphics were absolutely breathtaking, and everything else was very well done.
