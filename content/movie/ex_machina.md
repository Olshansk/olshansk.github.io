A very thought provoking film that had me question every element of the story on every single step. Who is actually the robot? Who is not? Who is being tested? Who is actually on top. To quote Nathan, the ending was "fucking unreal". There have been plenty of movies that challenge the potentiality of human kind's demise if AI were successful, but this was the first that really made me fear it. It was so subtle, so unexpected, so fucking unreal... While it was a little slow, and a little jumpy at times, it was ultimately the lack of coherence between different scenes, and the lack of insight into the characters that was also it's virtue.
