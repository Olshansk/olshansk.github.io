Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

For a film that came out more than two decades ago, the special effects did not disappoint. It was original, funk, and a little quirky. By appealing to a phase in one's life that everyone goes through, the park takes you on a thrilling ride showing you the consequences of what could happen if your dreams come true.
