A low budget film with character that isn't objectively amazing, but entertaining, a lot of fun, and with an original plot line.

The intersection of terrorism, time travel and religion is a big undertaking. At times, the movie as hilarious, cringy, querky, or just outright serious trying to deliver a real message.

My emotions are really mixed, but I would say that it's worth it if the premise of the plot entices you.
