Rating: ⭐⭐🌟

A familiar concept that has been revisited in numerous films in the past couple years, including District 9, Ex Machina, Her, and Transcendence just to name a few. While Chappie is very likable, childlike robot that has you rotting for him from the start, this film does not stand well against the competition. In an age where the smarter-than-human-AI-life-form is very ubiquitous, this film fails to challenge any core beliefs, provoke any new thought, and only serves to entertain.

It is worth noting that the graphics are phenomenal. There is a seamless barrier, both in terms of acting and visuals, between the actors the computer generated visuals.
