The plot is a little confusing and tries to do too much with little knowledge into the character's background. However, a strong cast takes a poor script a long way, and that's what happened here. If there is any reason to watch this film, it's just to see Emma Stone, Bradley Cooper, and Rachel McAdams having fun in Hawaii.
