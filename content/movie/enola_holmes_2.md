Sometimes I forget that Millie Bobby Brown isn't even 18, but is as talented as someone who has been doing this for a decade because she has!

The writing had a couple of surprises, but nothing mind-blowing. The chemistry between Elona and Sherlock was on point, but the rest of the cast only played a supporting role.

I enjoyed the film, but felt like there was an opportunity to leave a bigger impression.
