Very fun and informative film if you're not in the aerospace industry.

A must watch if you're in tech, a nerd, enjoy documentaries or are interested in
space to any degreed. If you're deep in the industry, I have a gut feeling you
might be watching it and calling out all the inaccuracies as I do when I'm
an "expert" in something.

Here's some context I got from a friend in the industry:

> Wild Wild Space is definitely a fun film. For people outside the industry it’s not ideal because although it’s entertaining, they kind of created this false narrative around Astra and RocketLab being in a race. TBH there’s not much to learn for me from it. The extremely R&D intensive nature of this work and the sheer messiness of it (literally working in the dirt sweating or freezing your butt off) means it’s really hard to apply significant learnings from any one company to another. Far too many variables and sensitivities to initial conditions/decisions. The key takeaway is SPACs are horrible, and in general you need to be very careful who you take money from. Taking the wrong amount from the wrong people, worse when it’s both, is a recipe for disaster. Really important to do everything you can to keep R&D costs low.
