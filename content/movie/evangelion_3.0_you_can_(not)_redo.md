My review of the second film sums up exactly how I feel about this one as well.

The best part is that this wasn't simply "more of the same". It was equally as original, equally as breathtaking, jaw-dropping and simply amazing. Even though most of the characters are the same, the writers did an awesome job at character development that we simply fast-forwarded through.
