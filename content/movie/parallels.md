Looking into the history behind the writing/producing/directing of this film, one quickly finds out that it was designed to be a pilot for a new TV series, and for that, it would have received 5 stars! A great new cast, with a concept that has a ton of potential, raising so many questions that you become immediately hooked! However, as a standalone film, it was very dissatisfying and I would not recommend watching it because it leaves you craving for something that will never get satisfied.
