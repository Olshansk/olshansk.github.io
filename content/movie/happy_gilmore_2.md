Just Adam Sandler having fun, and spreading his infectious joy to his friends, family and the audience.

The directors did a great job at making this film accessible to those who never watched the first one.

As a typical feel-good, Adam Sandler film, it was entertaining but flirting with cringey.

What made it great is realizing that both of his daughters played key characters, and that
a lot of the supporting cast are other actors, musicians, athletes or comedians that are likely
his friends.
