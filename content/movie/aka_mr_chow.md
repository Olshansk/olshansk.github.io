Not bad, but also not my favourite film to watch on an overnight flight.

I had never of Mr. Chow in the past and his character drew my attention. I can't say I was inspired or in awe, but I believe there's a lot to take away from his story and self confidence.

He's not hesitant, loves what he does, aims for perfection and is someone I have deep respect for after watching the film.

Not a must-watch, but if you're looking for something to watch on a flight, this is a good choice.
