This movie was absolutely amazing and is joining the ranks of one of my all time favorite movies.

Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay put up a brilliant performance, with unmatched chemistry, in a story that reaches the innermost depths of our compassion. The writing, acting and cinematography ameliorate a bad situation into a touching story.

From a tiny room where a mother and her son seem to live an uneasy and secluded, bu bear a very tight relationship, to a much larger world where opportunities have no limit but they can only hold on to each by a thin strand of hair.

I watched this movie more than a day ago and haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. It has made me reflect, think
