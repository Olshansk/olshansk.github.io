In a world where virtual and augmented reality is still in its infancy, this film is a dystopian allegory challenging the ethics of just how far we're willing to go for eternal happiness and entertainment when we can deal with the hardships of life.

I was a little confused about the ending, but highly recommend the explanation detailed here: http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/28407/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-congress/28486#28486?newreg=cdcafdc9da4948788342057b7a6ae6db
