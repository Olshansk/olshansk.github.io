A typical cohen brothers film that checks off all of the cohen checkboxes, yet not their best film to date. It felt a lot like argo, but some of the characters were lacking connection with their plot.

I ended up watching this a second time before I had no recollection of what happened the first time. It was fascinating because as I was watching the film, I could start remembering that something is going to happen, or that someone is going to die, but I had no way of saying exactly who or how it'll happen. The film was funny, enjoyable and entertaining, but trying to understand how my memory works was  what I concentrated on most of the time. I felt as if I had watched it, but I couldn't tell if it was a distant dream or a true memory. I had an extremely vague recollection of the characters, but couldn't predict even one move. Watching this a second time really made me question how human memories work.
