A rom-com is part of my regular "burnout recovery" routine, and this was exactly what the doctor ordered :)

After a few tough weeks at work, I took half of Friday off, went on a walk in the Botanical Gardens, spent some time in the Sauna, made a nice dinner and started eating while watching this film. The improvement in mood was unparalleled.

For a rom-com to be good, everyone on the cast has to have a lot of fun making it. You can tell that Glen and Sydney were having a blast with every moment. Though the supporting cast was "weaker", they did what they had to do: support.

Secondly, you need love and chemistry. Apparently the director was Sydney's fiancee, and Glen has a girlfriend, so I won't say anything else.

Thirdly, you need some originality in the script. This whole wedding getaway, with the boat and the helicopter, was a nice touch. It had the right amount of unrealism, realism, cringiness, romance and fire.

Last, you need the case to be good looking. That's not a problem ;)

Highly recommend watching this interview after watching the film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U855AUQrvA
