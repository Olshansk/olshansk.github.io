Rating this film feels more like rating Warren Buffet as a person.

The film itself was perfect, making it feel like Warren was speaking to me the whole time. A very good use of old footage, current footage, and getting to experience Buffet's life in different atmospheres. It felt like there was little friction and no wall between us.

The brilliance, success, kind-heartedness, humility and humbleness of Warren Buffet comes across crystal clear, and his investing career is just the cherry on top.
