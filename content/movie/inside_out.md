It's hard not to love this movie. All of Pixar's movies are very good, but this one in particular really stands out. It is an original, beautiful, fun movie that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. While the main demographic this movie is targeted at are kids, adults will get just as much, if not more, out of watching it. 

Life is not all joy and happiness, and nothing sticks around forever. This movie reminds us that we should cherish every moment, keep our loved ones close, and always make the most out of change even though the future may sometimes seem bleak.
