A great parallel to the whole Marvel universe that I was never aware of. It's not as mind-blowing as "Age of Ultron" or "Endgame", but definitely still entertaining and worth a watch.

At the same time, it's great to see the cast expand to have actors I love such as Kit Harington and Harry Styles :D
