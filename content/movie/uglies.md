It's not that common that I don't finish a movie, but I have no interest in finishing this one.

The plot is okay, the acting is fine, the special effects are cool, but together it's just overplayed.

This film may have stood its ground a decade ago, but it has to be 10x better than hunger games to compete today.

There's too much other good stuff out there that I wouldn't waste my time on this.
