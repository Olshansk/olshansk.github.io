As a time travel movie buff, I couldn't skip over this one albeit the low ratings. A very cool concept, with a pretty common spin on time travel paradoxes, an intertwined love story, and not one, but two hot chicks! Overall, it was pretty entertaining and requires very little thought, but there isn't much else to say.
