A very slow yet moving film with amateurish cinematography and acting. The movie drags on for the majority of the time but is dispersed with very engaging scenes throughout holding me back from drifting away into empty space. The concept is very interesting and I am very pleased with the fact that the ending provides undebatable closure to the story. Definitely worth a watch if you have the time and patience.
