A great set of actors portraying complex characters, preceded by a couple great films, does not grant this part 1 (the "set-up") of the last book to take a step back and just roll on the screen. As a fan of the book series and the first two films, I've got to say that there was passion, excitement and a sense of realism in this one. As hard as it to say, I think Jennifer tried too hard...
