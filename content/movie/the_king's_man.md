Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

A very fun continuation of the series that, though less graphic, still captures the same essence with a fun twist on history.

I, embarrassingly, didn't know that Rasputin was a real person so there was an educational aspect to it, and I'm looking forward to the next movie in the prequel series.
