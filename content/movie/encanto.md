My favourite Disney movie since Frozen! The musical numbers simply took it over the top.

I love the fact that it wasn't centred around the love affair of a prince and a princess, but rather the relationship within a family. A lot of the pressure people are feeling at work and in their personal lives these days were portrayed well, and the film managed to teach great lessons without feeling cheesy.

The musical numbers of brilliant, the animation was on point, the plot was original, and it is a movie I'd actually consider rewatching.
