Rating: ⭐🌟

The book was made up of interesting elements, but was subpar at best. It was meant to convey a distopic future closely correlated to our current world, but was a far cry from 1984.

Though the film had a strong cast, the plot was thin. It felt jumpy, didn't delve into the details and simply tried to cover all everything written in the book. It felt like it was trying to tick checkboxes, and ended up doing a lot of things poorly rather than a few things well. The ending felt expedited either because they realized the film was getting too long or because they ran out of funding, but it felt awkward... Not Emma's best role unfortunately...
