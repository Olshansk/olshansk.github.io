Surprisingly multi-dimensional.

When I first started watching this film, I thought that the choice for the computer graphics design was unique, but I was blown away when I learnt that it was stop motion.

The film's title seemingly targets children and fans of the classic story of Pinocchio, but it is so much more. It's a children's story, but it makes a bold statement of fascism, alludes to many biblical stories (such as Jonah and the Whale), and lets the goddess of death play a key role. The film reflects on the boundary between life, death and immortality, all while making us remember and appreciate that it is those around us whom we should never take for granted.

Not just a must-watch, but a must-re-watch.
