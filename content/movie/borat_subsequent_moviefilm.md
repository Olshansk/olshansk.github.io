Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Surprisingly exceeded all my expectations!

The first movie felt a little too "stupid" for me, so I was slightly hesitant to watch the second one but am glad I did. It was satirical, funny, original, entertaining and not TOO ridiculous.

After watching "The Spy", my respect for Sacha Baron Cohen skyrocketed because I realized he is an extremely multi-dimensional characters. Everything he does as Borat is legitimate acting and takes skill; he's not just being himself.

Trying to distinguish which parts of the movie were real and which parts were fully owned by actors were an entertaining and difficult exercise. MOST of the scenes were very real, so it's actually astounding the type of footage he was able to get. He caught Rudy Giuliani being okay with accepting sexual favors and got a few Republicans to admit thinking that Democarts are daemons. 

Also, anyone who speaks multiple languages (I know Russian and Hebrew) realizes the second-level meta jokes. Borat speaks a weird mix of Tatar & Hebrew to hist daughter, and his daughter speaks in Bulgarian back to him. Anyone who only knows english would have never figured this out, but it made the whole film so much more ridiculous.
