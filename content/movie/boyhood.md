Though I am usually a fan of films like this, I found that this film was overhyped and overrated because of the novelty of it being filmed over a 12 year period. The film editing was poor, the acting was mediocre, and the story was very plain, almost abrupt at various spots as the jumps in time felt unexpected and not very well transitioned. If different similar looking actors were used to play the part of the main character at various ages, I don't think this movie would have received any attention. A simple gimmick is  not enough to tell a good story.
