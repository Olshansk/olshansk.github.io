A classic that definitely stands the test of time.

A moving and captivating plot, with amazing actors, that progresses at exactly  the right pace.  Some scenes felt like they were cut short, but everything that needed to be said was.

Some of the scene transitions felt a little sudden and out of place, but it did not detract from the film at all. It simply goes to show how much cinmeatography has progressed over the past 20 years.
