Very different than other superhero "origin story" films but I absolutely loved it. A teeange spiderman, with a hot Aunt May, a supersuit from Tony Stark. This is unlike any other spiderman I could have ever envisioned, but it still managed to keep the fun and responsible essence that your friendly neigherbhood spiderman is at heart.
