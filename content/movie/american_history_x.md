Edward Norton and Edward Furlong provide an amazing performance, accompanied by a gripping narrative that tackles some very deep sociological troubles. Kaye manages to show a very objective view of multiple sides to the same story without a biased preference. The film did not feel like there was any part missing, nor was there anything unnecessarily excessive.
