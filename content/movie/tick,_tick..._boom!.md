As a musical fanatic, I absolutely loved everything about this movie. It is a must see if you like going to musicals or watching musical Disney films.

Andrew Garfield's singing and dancing caught me by surprise, and you could tell there was chemistry between the entire cast. The story was heart warming and what makes it even better is that it's all based on a true story. I was captivated at every step along the way.

The emotion associated with the HIV epidemic, the troubled relationship with his girlfriend, his passion for theatre all shined and delivered a message in their own way.

When I first started watching this film, I got about 7 minutes in and paused it because I knew my mom and sister would love it too. After watching it together, I was completely correct :). There's no question that I would watch this film all over again.
