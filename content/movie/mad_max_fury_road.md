This was a very good, original entertaining film. Great cinematography, original concept, a little weird and different from anything I've seen before. However, I can't say it blew me away or provoked some sort of innate feeling or thought. It's worth watching but was overhyped in my opinion.

I really enjoyed the fact that there was no forced romance, and no sappy background story about why the girl didn't have an arm. The film didn't try to fulfill any cliche expectations.
