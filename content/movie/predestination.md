A poignant love(?) story interspersed with action and confusion, causing you to continuously vacillate between any predictions you may have made along the way. Exploring transgender implications amok temporal paradoxes, this film keeps you hanging on a thin thread from the abyss of complete disorientation, and culminates with a very satisfying revelation. Brilliant performances by both Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook!
