Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

A mind-bending thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole film. The plot was original, the actors were fantastic and every scene in the film had a purpose.

This was really fun to watch with friends and discuss what's going to happen along the way.

I must also add that the late 90s had a series of really amazing films and am upset at the lack of similar films in modern times.
