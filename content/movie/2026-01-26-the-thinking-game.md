This film is simultaneously inspiring and depressing.

Demis Hassabis is a genius, a prodigy, an inspiration, a leader, a visionary, a curious soul, and a force of nature.

More importantly, he is a selfless human being who genuinely wants to make the world a better place.

As an engineer, a scientist, and an aspiring entrepreneur, I know I have to find my own path, but it is hard not to compare myself to him.

Was I a competitive national champion chess player in my youth? No.

Was I offered $1M at 17 before going to college? No.

Did I start a world-changing company before I turned 30? No.

Am I on a path to receive a Nobel Prize in chemistry? Not yet.

Will I play a critical role in enabling the most important technological revolution in human history? I will likely just leverage what Demis and his peers started.

I am grateful, inspired, motivated, and excited about everything this film presented, but it did make me feel a bit inadequate.
