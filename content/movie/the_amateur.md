Good, but not memorable.

Rami Malek and Laurence Fishburne are a great recipe for success, and Rami
definitely carried the movie.

It has been many years since I last watched Dr. Robot, so it was great to see
him in a similar role again.

With that said, two days after watching the film, I had no clue what it was about.

While I enjoyed every moment, and seeing Rami in his domain, the lack of memorability speaks for itself.
