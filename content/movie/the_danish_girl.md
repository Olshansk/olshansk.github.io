Rating: ⭐⭐⭐🌟

An unnerving film that created a sense of admiration, confusion, and unsettledness throughout. Lily felt real, but made me feel uncomfortable throughout. While Gerda was a thoughtful and genuine person that show care and empathy for others, Lily was tied up in her own world and did not deserve the support she had. It's understandable that a struggle such as this will consume most of one's energy, but it created a disconnect between the viewer and Lily.

I'm very impressed by the effort put into the set and costumes, because it really did look as if it was shot in the early 1900s.
