Rating: ⭐⭐🌟

A cheesy plot with several misfit characters bunching up together to save the galaxy while making cringing jokes does not make a good film if you throw enough CGI at it. Though there were a few funny moments, and some cool looking scenes, this film was not thought provoking, nor was it emotional, and even bordered on boring at some of the most climactic moments. Very disappointed.
