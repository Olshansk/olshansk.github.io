This films leaves an impact.

Every actress in this film that portrayed a victim showed a differing but
real range of emotions and I couldn't help but feel for everyone who was
hurt along the way.

It's hard to believe that a serial killer appeared on a national dating game
show... But, the triumph that comes when the runaway teenager makes sure he
gets caught is a win for everyone. Her emotional intelligence in asking him
to keep it a secret because she'd be embarrassed herself is brilliant.

The film was just the right amount of time (1.5 hours) to tell the store, deliver
the emotion and finish off with some details of what happened to Rodney Alcala
after the fact.

Lastly, Anna Kendrick killed it: both as a direct as an actress. This film really
made me want to watch more of her work.
