A fun easy listen that reiterates the most fundamental concepts of long term investing until it's etched into your brain.







If you've been investing for some time, this book will probably not introduce any concepts you're not already aware of. However, I would still recommend it because it reiterates and reminds you of basic concepts. In addition, it's a very well known piece of literature in the investment community so it's worth reading just to be well rounded. In fact, this would be a great book to read before picking up Deep Value by Tobias Carlisle.







If you're completely new to investing, have no clue what you're doing, but are interested in doing something other than indexing, then this is the book for you!
