This read has been long overdue, and it was definitely worth it!







Unlike other science fiction books I’ve read, this one had a very “Scary Movie” type of feel. It was simple, jumped around quite a bit, has some overly absurd sections, and was funny enough to make me laugh out loud while reading it on the bus.







It’s quite evident that the content of the book was more targeted at a podcast, or a theatrical screenplay rather than a novel, but everything is obvious in retrospect so I might be biased.







There is definitely a protagonist, but there is no main plotline. Randomness is what guides the character from one spot to another. Weird shit happens and he just deals with it. There’s no innate meaning, or some high moral lessons to take away. This book is just about taking science fiction to the extreme, and challenging the most outrageous ideas you think you may have had with even more ridiculous ones.







I recommend to save this book for a very late night, an “adjusted” mindset, or when you simply want to relax while reading. It’s definitely worth reading if you’re into sci-fi, but don’t expect it to blow your mind; only your funny bone.
