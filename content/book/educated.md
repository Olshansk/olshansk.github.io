I first heard of this book when Bill Gates reviewed it a few years back. It has been recommended to me by several people but I’ve been hesitant to pick it up since I thought I wouldn’t enjoy it. I didn’t find the first half of the book either relatable or intriguing, but it set the necessary backstory for the second half to be so much more impactful.







I’m not sure how to review or reflect on a memoir, but am extremely impressed and motivated by Tara’s story. I really hope this shows that everyone can preserver regardless of the environment they grew up in.







At various points throughout the book, I had to remind myself that the events were taking place in Idaho and not some third world country. The patriarchal, religious, abusive family seems like such an outdated concept that I forgot it still happens in first world countries. Instances where this happened include:



- Brothers abusing their sisters.



- Husband forcing his wife to become a “mid-wife”.



- Preferring traditional medicine rather than modern medicine when both are available.



- Being anti-government and anti-hospital.



- “Putting all the kids to work in the farm”.







Though I couldn’t relate to Tara on most fronts, I could related to her on lack of common knowledge as she entered her adulthood. Similar to how she did not know what the holocaust was in College, I did not know of Mormon’s until I had met one in my second year of college. The other person looked at me as if I was crazy, and I was really embarrassed.







Most importantly, I must admit that I’m very motivated and driven by Tara’s success. A lot of people the tech industry suffer from imposter’s syndrome, but the mental and inter-personal conflicts that she had to overcome were so much more than that. Having listened to a few of her interviews, she seems like a very intelligent, well-read, respected honest and kind person. I can’t even begin to imagine what it was like to grow up in a family with a bipolar mother, a threatening brother, and unsupportive mother. She somehow managed to overcome and unlearn everything that was enforced onto her throughout childhood.







**There were a couple of interesting things I learnt from the book:**



1. Midwifing is illegal in the US, but apparently the only option for people without money or insurance.



2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion. I simply find this fascinating because of how much it associates with my background (being a Russian Jew) and having never heard of it. It is a fabricated antiseptic text where Jews plan out global domination. I honestly think this could be a great foundation for the plot of a comedic film starring James Franco.
