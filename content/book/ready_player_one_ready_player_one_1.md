A very fun, easy, entertaining read that depicts a no so distant future with some dystopic elements entangled into the mix because why not?







A small group of misfits find each other through a shared common goal, as they try to defeat the evil corporation that is set on taking over the world. The good guys win, a happy ending ensues, and the protagonist gets the girl. The only catch is that all (almost) the action takes place in the virtual world!







It's an interesting look into what gaming may hold in the near future, and reading this book made me all the more excited for it! While I'm a little young for most of the 80s references made, I could still identify some games, shows and things referenced which was kind of nostalgic.







Overall, it's worth a read if you're looking for something fun and entertaining. However, I think this is the type of book where the movie will very easily do it justice.
