Very good book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is has any interest in stocks, investing, wall street, or just the impact of financial policy on the general economy.







Michael Lewis is a great writer, of unique background, who found himself in very exciting circumstances, during very peculiar times. It was written in a very novel way, that varied between first person and third person writing styles, and it still amazes me that everything is based on true historical events.







This book contains a very good historical account of exactly what happened at Salomon brothers in the late 70s and 80s. Lewis Ranieri’s rise and fall, along with mortgage bond market. The precedence of Junk Bonds. The crash of the late 80s. Relationships between a trader and his client, a trader and his rabbis, between members of the same company, or even different companies. This book was extremely educational while maintaining a great sense of excitement and intrigue throughout. There was definitely never a dull moment. I loved reading about the back and from row student’s in the training class as much as I did about John Gutfreund battle with Michael Milken.







Most importantly, this book was not simply a historical regurgitation of various events, nor was it just an individual’s recollection of their time in the company, it was an amalgamation of an insider’s opinion, experience and point of view as he takes you on a journey through one of the most exciting times on Wall Street. Filled with insider rumors and jokes, Michael Lewis is the only man who could’ve written this book, and he wrote it to perfection.
