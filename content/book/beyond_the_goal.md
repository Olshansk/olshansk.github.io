Eliyahu provides an actionable approach, with real-life examples on how to build a business. He lays everything out clearly, concisely, and I love the Israeli chutzpah to present things as they are without beating around the bush.







Absolutely loved it, and is one of the few books I plan to relisten to within the next year.







Full review coming soon!
