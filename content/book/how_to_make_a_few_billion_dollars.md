## How to Make a Few Billion Dollars

Phenomenal book with lots of insights ranging from personal introspection, practical
anecdotes, relatable situations and meta concepts.

Planning to suggest it to all of my entrepreneur and founder friends when they ask for recommendations.

My favorite part was on the topic of "rewiring your mind". A chapter I'll re-read again.

From the M&A anecdotes, you can tell the author is a very seasoned executive.
I'm glad I read the book, but since I'm writing this review a few months later,
I have only maintained a "vibe" of the content. When the time is right, I'll read those parts

Lastly, this book really made me want to have Brad as an investor or advisor in my current
or future companies. Just putting it out there ;)

## Mindset & Personal Operating System

• Laser focus + passion: concentrate on what matters, drop perfectionism, improvise when conditions change.
• Problems = opportunities: run toward them; waiting for perfect terms causes “corporate constipation.”
• Radical acceptance: see facts as they are, cut losses fast, learn and adapt.
• Reframe negativity: treat anxious thoughts as data, ask “what’s the worst that can happen—how would I cope?”
• Thought experiments & meditation: daily “Gedanken” sessions expand perspective, spark calm, and surface big ideas.
• Cosmic perspective & love: feeling connected to the universe—and to people—puts the brain in a creative, decisive state.
• Stay humble: outside acclaim doesn’t replace inner purpose; keep ego in check.

## Spotting & Riding Big Trends

• “Get the big trend right.” Directional correctness forgives many execution mistakes.
• Obsessive research cycle: read everything, set alerts, mine SEC filings, quiz experts, refine questions, repeat.
• Track accelerating tech waves—AI, automation, 3-D printing, Singularity—to foresee threats and openings.
• Apply lessons early: oil-price arbitrage, data-driven equipment rentals, fully-automated truck brokerage.

## Technology & Data Advantage

• Build proprietary information pipes (the “crude internet”) to see markets sooner than competitors.
• Unify data in real time; let machines talk to machines—creates a self-reinforcing moat.
• Use analytics to price, position assets, and cut empty miles before rivals can react.
• Tech spend is non-optional: every next company leaned harder into software than the last.

## M&A Playbook

• Deal filter: will it delight customers and lift financial results?
• Pre-contact diligence checklist: growth drivers, realistic assumptions, AI/automation upside, cultural health, synergy math, regulatory land-mines.
• Sellers first: be honest, responsive, respectful; explain process; no “poker-face” posturing.
• Integration = thousands of tasks → assign each to one owner for accountability.
• Accept mistakes quickly (e.g., $0.5 B road-rental exit) rather than chase sunk costs.

## People: Hiring, Firing & Paying

• Only perfection goal = talent. Four must-haves: intelligence, hunger, integrity, collegiality.
• Ignore pedigree; judge ability. Prioritize high IQ—data show smarter teams outperform.
• A/B/C test: imagine they quit tomorrow—panic (A), shrug (B), relief (C). Act accordingly.
• Fire decisively yet compassionately; generous severance keeps dignity intact.
• Overpay A-players and align upside with company wins; skimping on key roles is costliest of all.

## Leadership, Meetings & Communication

• “Electric” meetings need: the right people, crowdsourced agenda, safe disagreement.
• Open Q&A (“ask me anything”) shows respect and keeps audiences engaged.
• Correct with validation first; override consensus rarely and with clear reasoning.
• Over-communicate—dense data or simple thanks—to employees, board, investors; frequency builds trust.
• Listening culture uncovers frontline best practices faster (cheaper than consultants).

## Personal Energy & Purpose

• Primary priorities: family, life experience, then work—yet run hard at all three.
• Meditation since teens sustains calm creativity under pressure.
• Extreme workloads happen (sleep is “overrated” during sprints) when the mission excites the team.
• Big dreams create societal good—jobs, philanthropy—while fulfilling personal meaning
