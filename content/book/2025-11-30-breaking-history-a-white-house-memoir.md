3.5 stars

I'm pausing this book approximately a third in.

I have a lot of respect and admiration for Jared, and will continue listening to each podcast he goes on.

The introduction in the book was great as I got to learn about him as a person.

However, but given that I don't know all the personalities along the way, it felt a little dense and I didn't feel like I was absorbing the information anymore.

With all of that said, I cannot wait to work with him one day!

This is just a quick in-flight summary, but full review incoming soon!
