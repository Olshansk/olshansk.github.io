Phenomenal and mind-bending! This book is definitely In my top 3 favorite sci-fi book of all time alongside Hyperion and 1Q84.







There’s nothing I can say to do this book justice: If you’re only going to read one sci-fi book in your life, this should be it.







I love how the story progressed and evolved. It started concentrating solely on political and scientific tensions in China. Then the author started sprinkling in bits of sci-fi and Fantasy to intrigue the reader. This was followed by several fascinating trips into the world of the Three Body Problem, which is very appropriate given the advent of VR around the time this book was written and released. With a slow and steady crescendo, the author reels you in, simultaneously teaching you new scientific concepts but also making you question reality. When the book introduced the Sophons, my mind was simply blown.







A cool Easter egg about the book is that the author used to work at a nuclear power plant and the translator is a software programmer. I found that this really legitimizes and correctly depicts the work and mindset of people in STEM.
