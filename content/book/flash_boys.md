Another fantastic book by Michael Lewis! He is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.







In the same style as all his other books we follow several parallel plots at the same time, learn about all the individual's backgrounds and experience, learn about the inner working of what happens on wall street, and have it delivered in a fun, easy to understand manner.







Rather than reiterating what I learnt and what was said, I simply recommend that you read this book even if you only have the faintest interest in stock exchanges. Michael Lewis makes learning extremely enjoyable.
