tl;dr John Von Neuman is a legend, but this book did not do him justice. I highly recommend reading the first two chapters, but there's no reason to keep going after that.

## Review of the Book's Writing

The book starts of strong, engaging and full of interesting stories of how John Von Neuman grew up. It was an insight into how he became the man he was.

But, after the first couple of chapters, it just turned into a historical account of the Manhattan Project, and the role he played. If it had been from his perspective, or had drawn on his own challenges, I'd love it. Unofrunatly, it just felt like a historical play by play.

I realized I was forcing myself to keep listening for the sake of finishing the book. After two chapters of doing so, I gave up.

I really wish he would have had the opportunity to write his own autobiography, so hopefully an alternative universe has that pleasure.

## Overall Perspective of John Von Neuman

John is the result of Nature, Nurture and luck. He was a prodigy, born at the right time, in the right place, in the right environment and into the right family.

He was gifted with a mathematical foundation, and had the opportunity to cultivate his curiosity.

**Von Neumann's Intellect and Knowledge**

- Those who knew Einstein, Gödel, and von Neumann thought he had the sharpest intellect.
- As a child, he absorbed languages, history, and could recite chapters verbatim decades later.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  His even joked that von Neumann was descended from a superior species, but had made a detailed study of human beings so he could imitate them perfectly. As a child, von Neumann absorbed ancient Greek and Latin and spoke French, German, and English as well as his native Hungarian. He devoured a 45-volume history of the world, and was able to recite whole chapters verbatim decades later.

**Von Neumann's Prescience**

- Von Neumann's mathematical contributions in the mid-20th century are increasingly prescient.
- Understanding his life and work is crucial for grasping intellectual trends in politics, economics, technology, and psychology.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  The mathematical contributions von Neumann made in the mid-20th century now appear more eerily prescient with every passing year. To fully understand the intellectual currents running through our century, from politics to economics, technology to psychology, one has to understand von Neumann's life and work In the last. His thinking is so pertinent to the challenges we face today that it is tempting to wonder if he was a time traveller, quietly seeding ideas that he knew would be needed to shape the Earth's Future. Born in 1903, von Neumann was just 22 years old when he helped to lay the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. He moved to America in 1930, and, realising early on that war

**Game Theory and the H-Bomb**

- Von Neumann's work on game theory with economist Oscar Morgenstern revolutionized economics and influenced fields from political science to military strategy.
- His focus shifted to building the ENIAC to assess the feasibility of a hydrogen bomb after his involvement in the Manhattan Project.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  The same year he joined the Manhattan Project, von Neumann was finishing with the economist Oscar Morgenstern, a 640-page treatise on game theory, a field of mathematics devoted To understanding conflict and cooperation. That book would change economics, make game theory integral to fields as disparate as political science, psychology, and evolutionary biology, and help military strategists to Think about when leaders should, and should not, push the nuclear button. With his unearthly intelligence and his unflinching attitude to matters of life and death, von Neumann was one of a handful of scientists who inspired the iconic Stanley Kubrick character, Dr. Strangelove. After the atom bombs he helped to design were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

**Von Neumann's Impact**

- Von Neumann constantly looked for practical fields to apply his mathematical genius.
- He chose fields with the potential to revolutionize human affairs, becoming more important as he moved from pure mathematics to physics, economics, and engineering.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  But mere intellectual puzzles, no matter how profound, were not enough for him. For Neumann constantly sought new practical fields to which he could apply his mathematical genius, and he seemed to choose each one with an unerring sense of its potential to revolutionize Human affairs. As he moved from pure mathematics to physics to economics to engineering, he became steadily less deep and steadily more important, observed von Neumann's former colleague, mathematical Physicist Freeman Dyson.

**Budapest's Jewish Community**

- In 1910, a quarter of Budapest's population, including many doctors, lawyers, and bankers, were Jewish.
- This success led to conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic rhetoric, with Vienna's mayor calling Budapest 'Judapest'.

**Von Neumann's Early Education**

- Max Neumann wanted his sons' education to prepare them for the worst, emphasizing foreign languages, ancient Greek, and Latin.
- Even as a child, Yanchi (John von Neumann) demonstrated formidable mental calculation abilities.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  By 1910, Max had sensed the darkening mood in Europe and wanted his son's education to prepare them for the worst. Children did not then start school in Hungary until the age of ten, but affluent Budapestian families had no problems finding nursemaids, governesses, or tutors. Max emphasized foreign languages, reasoning that his sons would then be able to make themselves understood no matter where they were or who happened to be in charge. So six-year Yanchi learned French from Mademoiselle Rosjean and Italian from Signora Puglia. Between 1914 and 1918 the brothers were also taught English by Mr. Thompson and Mr. Blythe. Though held as enemy aliens in Vienna at the start of the war, Max, a man of influence, had no difficulties in having their place of internment officially moved to Budapest. Max also insisted the boys learn ancient Greek and Latin. Father, Nicholas recalled in his memoirs, believed in the life of the mind. Yanchi was a formidable mental calculator even as a child.

  **Speaker 1**

  When his second wife, Clary, tried to persuade him to ski, he offered her a divorce. If being married to a woman, no matter who she was, would mean he had to slide around on two pieces of wood on some slick mountainside, she explained, he

**Von Neumann's Childhood Education**

- Von Neumann often avoided heated political arguments by recounting obscure historical events he'd learned from the Allgemeine Geschichte as a child.
- The von Neumann children's education often continued during meals, where they would present topics of interest and discuss them.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  When von Neumann became embroiled in American politics after he emigrated, he would sometimes avoid arguments that were threatening to become too heated by citing, sometimes word For word, outcome of some obscurely related affair in antiquity that he had read about in Onken as a child. The children's education often continued over lunch and dinner when they were encouraged to present a particular topic that had caught their attention earlier in the day. Once, for example, Nicholas read up on the poetry of Heinrich Heine, sparking a discussion on how anti-Semitism would affect them in the future. Heine was born into a

**Hungarian Brilliance**

- The outpouring of Hungarian brilliance between 1880 and 1920 may have been due to liberalism and feudalism.
- It was easier for Jews to rise to prominence in Austria-Hungary compared to other European countries.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Others believed the Hungarian phenomenon was driven by two apparently contradictory elements of Hungarian society at the time, liberalism and feudalism. It was easier for Jews to rise to prominence in Austria-Hungary than in many of its less liberal European neighbours, but the levers of power, in particular the civil service and military, Were almost entirely in the hands of the Hungarian upper classes.

**Quantum Theory**

- Bohr's quantum model, though brilliant, raised numerous questions about electron behavior.
- Physicists sought a more coherent theory, leading Heisenberg to formulate matrix mechanics.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Brilliant though it was, Bohr's model was a jury-rigged affair that raised as many questions as it answered. What held electrons in their special orbits? How did they hop from one to another in an instant? The more success the quantum theory enjoys, the more stupid it looks, said Einstein, who realized early on that the shotgun wedding of classical and quantum concepts could not last. Physicists soon wanted an amicable divorce. In 1925,

  **Speaker 1**

  Anxious to make his name with a big discovery, Schrodinger worked through a two-week tryst with an ex-lover in an alpine resort that Christmas, returning to Zurich in January to apply His new wave equation to some of the key problems that were being thrown up by atomic physics. A late erotic outburst was how Hermann Weill, a close friend of Schrödinger, and his wife's lover, would describe the deluge of academic papers that were to follow. Among them was a complete description of the hydrogen atom spectrum based on his theory, and a version of his equation that how the

  Less than twelve months later, were two. Both theories seemed to do the job, but were so different that many physicists wondered if they could both really be correct. Schrödinger confessed he was repelled by the instantaneous quantum jumps of Heisenberg's theory. When electron transitions took place in Schrodinger's theory, the wave function describing the atom changed smoothly from one form to another. Heisenberg was even blunter about the failings of Schrodinger's wave mechanics. It's crap, he wrote to Pauli. He was particularly disturbed by the physical picture that Schrödinger was trying to paint of the atoms in the workings. Heisenberg,

**Reconciling Quantum Theories**

- Scientists sought a deeper connection between Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schrödinger's wave mechanics.
- Both von Neumann and Hilbert had expertise in the underlying mathematics of quantum theory.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  There had to be some deeper connection, they reasoned, between Heisenberg's infinitely large arrays of numbers and Schrödinger's strange, formless waves of undulating probabilities. But what could it be? At Göttingen, von Neumann heard about matrix mechanics firsthand. He was keen to help Hilbert extend his programme of axiomatization to physics. By sheer coincidence, both he and his hero were experts in the underlying mathematics of quantum theory. In mathematical terms, Schrodinger was applying a mathematical operator, the energy operator known as the Hamiltonian, to his wave function to extract from it information about The energy of the system. Crudely speaking, operators are mathematical instructions. The solutions, i.e. The wave functions, to equations like Schrodinger's are eigenfunctions. The answers, i.e. The energy levels of an atom that pop out of the equation after Eigenfunctions are substituted in, are Eigenvalues. Hilbert himself had come up with these terms in 1904, based on the German word Eigen, meaning characteristic or inherent.

- Heisenberg's matrices and Schrödinger's continuous wave functions occupy different types of space.
- Von Neumann warns that relating the two theories involves difficulties and violence to mathematics.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Heisenberg's matrices, with their countable elements and Schrödinger's continuous wave functions, are said to occupy different types of space. Every attempt to relate the two, von Neumann warns, must run into great difficulties and cannot be achieved without some violence to the formalism and to mathematics. One person who nonetheless tried to do exactly that was the taciturn British theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, whom novelist Ian McEwan describes as a man entirely claimed by science, Bereft of small talk and other human skills. His Cambridge colleagues even named a unit of speech after him. A Dirac amounted to a single solitary word per hour.

- Dirac merged Heisenberg's discrete space and Schrödinger's continuous space in his 1930 book.
- He used a mathematical device called the Dirac delta function.

  **Speaker 1**

  Dirac began to expound his version of quantum theory in 1925. In his 1930 book, The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, he set out an ingenious trick to merge the discrete space of Heisenberg's matrices and the other continuous space of Schrödinger's Waves. The key to Dirac's approach was a special mathematical device that is now named after him, the Dirac delta function.

**Quantum Mechanics Interpretations**

- Physicists have struggled to understand the meaning of quantum mechanics since its beginning.
- There's still no agreement on its meaning, despite the practical applications of quantum theory.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Physicists have wrestled with what quantum mechanics is really telling us about the nature of the physical world since its early days. The failure to come up with an acceptable interpretation of the theory even led students at Schrodinger's University to make up a ditty, gently ribbing their great professor. Erwin with his psi can do calculations quite a few, but one thing has not been seen. Just what does psi really mean? The existence of GPS, computer chips, lasers, and electron microscopes attest that quantum theory works beautifully. But nearly a hundred years after Heisenberg published his paper on matrix mechanics, there is still no agreement on its meaning. In the interim, a plethora of exotic ideas have been put forward to make sense of what quantum physics is saying about reality. All have their passionate advocates, but none have yet been proven. Physicists ruefully joke that though new interpretations of quantum physics arrive with astonishing none ever go away. For many, that joke is turning sour. It is a bad sign, theoretical physicist Stephen Weinberg noted recently, that those physicists today who are most comfortable with quantum mechanics do not agree with one another About what it all means.

**Observer's Role in Quantum Measurement**

- Von Neumann argues that any quantum measurement sequence must end with someone perceiving the events.
- Therefore, we must always divide the world into the observed system and the observer.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  But no matter how many steps we add, von Neumann argues, the sequence of events must end with someone perceiving these events. That is, he says, we are obliged always to divide the world into two parts, the one being the observed system, the other the observer. But what about the steps in between? The most straightforward interpretation of quantum mechanics would seem to require that any number of such steps would lead to the same result, at least as far as the observer is concerned.

**Quantum Entanglement**

- Measuring one entangled object instantly collapses the wave function of the entire system, even across vast distances.
- Einstein called this consequence of entanglement 'spooky action at a distance,' but von Neumann was more relaxed about it.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  This means that measuring some property of one of the pair instantly collapses the wave function of the whole system, even if the objects are separated by some vast distance after their Initial interaction. Einstein, who was probably the first to fully appreciate this consequence of entanglement and did not like it one bit, called it spooky action at a distance. Von Neumann was always rather more relaxed about the weirder aspects of quantum physics than Einstein.

**Princeton's Recruitment Strategy**

- Oswald Weblen at Princeton poached European mathematicians, including von Neumann and Wigner, with lucrative salaries.
- He used Rockefeller Foundation money to build Fine Hall and wanted top talent to fill it.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Towards the end of October 1930, Wigner had received, out of the blue, an offer of a one-term lectureship from Princeton University. If that were not enough, the telegram quoted a salary so high, more than seven times what Wigner was earning in Berlin, he thought there must have been a mistake during the message's Transmission. He quickly learned that von Neumann had received a letter from Princeton a couple of weeks earlier with the offer of even more money. It was clearly Yanchi that Princeton really wanted, said Wigner. Unbeknownst to him, von Neumann's letter asked if Wigner should be invited too. Luckily for Wigner, von Neumann agreed this would be a good idea. He added that there would, however, be a short delay before he could take up the post because he wanted to fix a family matter. Von Neumann was going to Budapest to get married. The scheme to entice the two Hungarians had been cooked up by Oswald Weblen, a distinguished Princeton professor of mathematics. America was an intellectual backwater, and Weblen wanted to change that by poaching some of Europe's most brilliant mathematicians with the offer of huge American salaries. He had secured millions of dollars from the Rockefeller Foundation and wealthy private donors to erect grand new building named Fine Hall for the Mathematics Department. Now he just needed the mathematicians to fill it. Veblen came under pressure from the wider faculty to hire a physicist.

  While Bohm's theory struggled to win widespread acceptance, though Bell continued to champion it, another was to be ignored altogether, only to spawn countless science fiction Stories and half-baked mystical philosophies and more than a few research papers it re-emerged over a decade later. The progenitor of the many worlds interpretation was a young American theorist named Hugh Everett III, who began his graduate studies at Princeton University in the mathematics Department. By coincidence, he spent his first year working on game theory, a field which von Neumann had helped found with his

**Von Neumann's Mathematical Gift**

- Freeman Dyson says that Von Neumann's unique gift was transforming mathematical problems into problems of logic.
- He could intuitively see the logical essence of problems and use simple rules of logic to solve them.

**Foundational Crisis**

- The foundational crisis in mathematics stemmed from flaws found in Euclid's Elements, the geometry standard for centuries.
- This crisis, questioning long-held assumptions, ultimately spurred advancements leading to modern computing.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  The roots of the foundational crisis lay in the discovery of flaws in Euclid's Elements, the standard textbook in geometry for centuries. Euclid had devised five statements that he assumed to be self-evident, his axioms or postulates. By building on these through a series of logical steps, he proved a number of more complex statements, theorems, including Pythagoras's theorem, the square of the longest side of A right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This axiomatic method was the cornerstone of mathematics, and the planets were assumed to wheel through the sorts of three-dimensional space the elements described. At the start of the 19th century, only one true geometry was thought possible. Euclidean geometry was a repository of truths about the world that was as certain as any knowledge could be, says historian Jeremy Gray. It was also the space of Newtonian physics. It was the geometry dimmed into one at school. If it failed, what sort of useful knowledge was possible at all? That first step towards shattering that orthodoxy was taken in the 1830s by Janosz Boyoy, another Hungarian mathematical prodigy, and Nikolai Lobachevsky, a Russian. Both independently developed geometries in which the last of Euclid's five statements, his parallel postulate, was not true. Compared with the other postulates, the fifth stood out. The second postulate, for example, says that any line segment may be extended indefinitely.

**Von Neumann's Math Rescue**

- Von Neumann aimed to remove the concept of 'sets of all sets' from the definitions of cardinality and ordinality.
- This was an initial effort to preserve Cantor's set theory, which was essential for mathematical manipulation and theorem proving.

**Sets vs. Classes**

- Von Neumann resolved Russell's paradox by distinguishing between sets and classes.
- This distinction prevents the contradictions that arise from considering 'a set of all sets'.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Here one can divine the germ of von Neumann's future interest in computing machines and the mechanization of proofs. The paper resolved Russell's paradox by distinguishing between two distinct sorts of collections. He called them one-dingen and two-dingen, one-things and two-things. Mathematicians now tend to call them, respectively, sets and classes. Von Neumann rigorously defines a class as a collection of sets that share a property. In his theory,

**Beyond Bomb Calculations**

- Von Neumann was interested in ENIAC for more than just bomb creation.
- He was thinking about a radically different kind of computer from the moment he saw it.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Unknown Speaker (Narrator)**

  Von Neumann's interest in the ENIAC went far beyond its usefulness as a tool for creating better bombs. From the first moment he saw it, he was thinking of a radically different kind of computer altogether. Of the ENIAC's drawbacks were recognized by its designers early on in the project. Of the 150 kilowatts of power it consumed, more than half was used to either heat or cool the tubes. Despite rigorous procedures for stress testing new batches and rejecting those that did not pass muster, a chew blew every couple of days. To minimize the disruption caused by malfunctioning parts and broken connections, the ENIAC's components were arranged in standardized plug-in units that could quickly be removed

**Gödel's Proof Checking**

- Gödel created a system to check any proof using math by assigning numbers to statements and logical operations.
- This allows for the creation of a proof-checking machine.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Unknown Speaker (Narrator)**

  With his coding system established, Gerdel was able to provide a process whereby any proof could be checked by simple maths. First, decompose the Gerdel number of the proof by following the decryption rules of G scheme. Eventually, this will reveal the Gödel numbers of the proof's axioms. Then simply check that the Gödel numbers of the axioms are indeed those that are allowed by the system, i.e. The axioms of the Principia. The process is repetitive, so Gödel defined combination of primitive recursive functions, essentially mathematical loops, to do the decoding, producing an algorithm, a sort of Proof-checking machine that could test any theorem. The question of whether a theorem is valid becomes a question of doing sums, albeit quite complicated ones. Put the Gödel number of the theorem into the machine, turn the handle until the Gödel numbers of the axioms pop out, then consult the list

  **Speaker 1**

  His even joked that von Neumann was descended from a superior species, but had made a detailed study of human beings so he could imitate them perfectly. As a child, von Neumann absorbed ancient Greek and Latin and spoke French, German, and English as well as his native Hungarian. He devoured a 45-volume history of the world, and was able to recite whole chapters verbatim decades later.

**Von Neumann's Prescience**

- Von Neumann's mathematical contributions in the mid-20th century are increasingly prescient.
- Understanding his life and work is crucial for grasping intellectual trends in politics, economics, technology, and psychology.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  The mathematical contributions von Neumann made in the mid-20th century now appear more eerily prescient with every passing year. To fully understand the intellectual currents running through our century, from politics to economics, technology to psychology, one has to understand von Neumann's life and work In the last. His thinking is so pertinent to the challenges we face today that it is tempting to wonder if he was a time traveller, quietly seeding ideas that he knew would be needed to shape the Earth's Future. Born in 1903, von Neumann was just 22 years old when he helped to lay the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. He moved to America in 1930, and, realising early on that war

**Game Theory and the H-Bomb**

- Von Neumann's work on game theory with economist Oscar Morgenstern revolutionized economics and influenced fields from political science to military strategy.
- His focus shifted to building the ENIAC to assess the feasibility of a hydrogen bomb after his involvement in the Manhattan Project.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  The same year he joined the Manhattan Project, von Neumann was finishing with the economist Oscar Morgenstern, a 640-page treatise on game theory, a field of mathematics devoted To understanding conflict and cooperation. That book would change economics, make game theory integral to fields as disparate as political science, psychology, and evolutionary biology, and help military strategists to Think about when leaders should, and should not, push the nuclear button. With his unearthly intelligence and his unflinching attitude to matters of life and death, von Neumann was one of a handful of scientists who inspired the iconic Stanley Kubrick character, Dr. Strangelove. After the atom bombs he helped to design were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

  But mere intellectual puzzles, no matter how profound, were not enough for him. For Neumann constantly sought new practical fields to which he could apply his mathematical genius, and he seemed to choose each one with an unerring sense of its potential to revolutionize Human affairs. As he moved from pure mathematics to physics to economics to engineering, he became steadily less deep and steadily more important, observed von Neumann's former colleague, mathematical Physicist Freeman Dyson.

**Von Neumann's Early Education**

- Max Neumann wanted his sons' education to prepare them for the worst, emphasizing foreign languages, ancient Greek, and Latin.
- Even as a child, Yanchi (John von Neumann) demonstrated formidable mental calculation abilities.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  By 1910, Max had sensed the darkening mood in Europe and wanted his son's education to prepare them for the worst. Children did not then start school in Hungary until the age of ten, but affluent Budapestian families had no problems finding nursemaids, governesses, or tutors. Max emphasized foreign languages, reasoning that his sons would then be able to make themselves understood no matter where they were or who happened to be in charge. So six-year Yanchi learned French from Mademoiselle Rosjean and Italian from Signora Puglia. Between 1914 and 1918 the brothers were also taught English by Mr. Thompson and Mr. Blythe. Though held as enemy aliens in Vienna at the start of the war, Max, a man of influence, had no difficulties in having their place of internment officially moved to Budapest. Max also insisted the boys learn ancient Greek and Latin. Father, Nicholas recalled in his memoirs, believed in the life of the mind. Yanchi was a formidable mental calculator even as a child.

**Von Neumann's Childhood Education**

- Von Neumann often avoided heated political arguments by recounting obscure historical events he'd learned from the Allgemeine Geschichte as a child.
- The von Neumann children's education often continued during meals, where they would present topics of interest and discuss them.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  When von Neumann became embroiled in American politics after he emigrated, he would sometimes avoid arguments that were threatening to become too heated by citing, sometimes word For word, outcome of some obscurely related affair in antiquity that he had read about in Onken as a child. The children's education often continued over lunch and dinner when they were encouraged to present a particular topic that had caught their attention earlier in the day. Once, for example, Nicholas read up on the poetry of Heinrich Heine, sparking a discussion on how anti-Semitism would affect them in the future. Heine was born into a

**Hungarian Brilliance**

- The outpouring of Hungarian brilliance between 1880 and 1920 may have been due to liberalism and feudalism.
- It was easier for Jews to rise to prominence in Austria-Hungary compared to other European countries.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Others believed the Hungarian phenomenon was driven by two apparently contradictory elements of Hungarian society at the time, liberalism and feudalism. It was easier for Jews to rise to prominence in Austria-Hungary than in many of its less liberal European neighbours, but the levers of power, in particular the civil service and military, Were almost entirely in the hands of the Hungarian upper classes.

  Von Neumann proposed in his way two years later. You and I could have a lot of fun together, he told her. For instance, you like to drink wine, and so do I. The two were married on New Year's Day, 1930, and sailed to America on a luxury liner. Mariette, horribly seasick, was confined to her quarters for the whole voyage. House hunting did not go well at first either. Despite the generous salary Princeton was paying, nothing within their budget could match the European grandeur to which they were accustomed.

  There were no cafes for mathematicians to congregate, so Mariette entertained von Neumann's colleagues at home. Next, there was the problem of getting about. Von Neumann enjoyed driving very much, but had never passed a test. At Mariette's suggestion, he bribed a driving examiner. This did nothing to improve his driving. He sped along crowded roads as if there were many body problems to be negotiated by calculating the best route through on the fly. He often failed, and an intersection in Princeton was soon christened Von Neumann Corner on account of the many accidents he had there. Bored on open roads, he slowed down. When conversation faltered, he would sing, swaying and rocking the steering wheel from side to side with him. The couple would buy a new car every year, usually because von Neumann had totaled the previous one. His vehicle of choice was a Cadillac.

The couple would buy a new car every year, usually because von Neumann had totaled the previous one. His vehicle of choice was a Cadillac. Because, he explained, whenever anyone asked, no one would sell me a tank. Miraculously, he escaped largely unscathed from these mash-ups, often returning with the unlikeliest of explanations. I was proceeding down the road, begins one fabulous excuse. The trees on the right were passing me in orderly fashion at sixty miles an hour. Suddenly one of them stepped in my path. Boom! The only worst driver in Princeton was Wigner. Overcautious rather than reckless, Wigner would roll along as far to the right as he could manage, sometimes causing pedestrians to scatter by mounting the curb. A Princeton graduate student named Horner Cooper was asked to teach Wigner how to drive properly. Mariette would leave Johnny for Cooper in 1937. On the 28th of January 1933, two days before Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, John von Neumann became a beneficiary of Weblen's largesse with other people's money. Weblen had long dreamed of an independent mathematics institute where scholars on huge salaries could think big thoughts unburdened from any irksome teaching commitments.

  He had shared his vision with Abraham Flexner, an influential expert on higher education who helped to secure the Rockefeller Foundation's cash to help build Princeton's fine hall. Flexner returned to him with more good news. The German-Jewish owners of Bambergers, a chain of department store, had sold up to R.H. Macy& Co. And wanted to spend some of the proceeds on a new school for higher learning. For its first six years, the Institute for Advanced Study, IAS, was housed in Fine Hall. Flexner was appointed the Institute's first director in May 1930 with a salary of nearly $400,000 in modern terms. He hired Veblen as its first professor in 1932.

**IAS Salaries**

- Von Neumann joined the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) at 29 with no teaching obligations.
- His salary was $10,000, close to $200,000 today, leading to it being nicknamed the 'Institute for Advanced Salaries'.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  So too did von Neumann and his fellow mathematicians Hermann and James Alexander. Von Neumann was 29 when he moved to the IAS from Princeton, the youngest of the new recruits. There was no obligation to teach. Indeed, there were no students, and staff were required to be on the premises for only half the year. The remainder of the time they were officially on leave. Senior professors like Einstein earned $16,000, while an ordinary professor like von Neumann received an annual salary of $10,000, close to $200,000 today. A pretty sum now, and in Depression-era America almost obscene.

**Institute for Advanced Salaries**

- The Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) was mockingly called the Institute for Advanced Salaries due to the high salaries and lack of teaching obligations.
- Some professors, unused to this lifestyle, became unproductive, as highlighted by Richard Feynman.

  **Speaker 1**

  A pretty sum now, and in Depression-era America almost obscene. Envious Princetonians dubbed the moneyed academy a stone's throw away, the Institute for Advanced Salaries, and the Institute for Advanced Lunch. Unused to the gilded existence, some professors would lapse into somnolence. These poor bastards could now sit and think clearly all by themselves. OK, wrote one critic, the Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman. They have every opportunity to do something and they're not getting any ideas. Nothing happens because there's not enough real activity and challenge. You're not in contact with the experimental guys. You don't have to think how to answer questions from the student. Nothing. Einstein would spend his Princeton years in unfruitful

**Von Neumann's Personality**

- Ulam described Von Neumann's eyes as brown, large, vivacious, and full of expression and noted his impressively large head and waddling walk.
- Ulam also observed that Von Neumann felt most comfortable with third or fourth generation wealthy Jews.

  The first thing that struck me about him were his eyes, brown, large, vivacious, and full of expression. His head was impressively large. He had a sort of waddling walk. Von Neumann offered Ulam a stipend to come to the IAS for a few months. He was ill at ease with people who were self-made or came from modest backgrounds, says Ulam von Neumann in Princeton. He felt most comfortable with third or fourth generation wealthy Jews. Von Neumann's home life was difficult, Ulam noted. He may not have been an easy

  The massive effort to build the atom bomb, codenamed Project Y, would cost the US $2 billion, more than $20 billion today, and at its height employ more than 100,000 people. In September 1942, the 46-year army engineer Leslie Groves was appointed to lead it.

**Oppenheimer's Selection**

- Despite Oppenheimer's lack of management experience and left-wing associations, General Groves chose him to head the top-secret laboratory for developing the atom bomb.
- Oppenheimer's communist ties would later be used to strip him of his security clearance, ending his government work.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  The very next month, Groves chose Oppenheimer to head the top-secret laboratory that would develop the bomb. Oppenheimer was not an obvious choice. A theorist with little experience of managing a large team, he would somehow have to exert his authority over scientists, many of whom had Nobel Prizes. Worst of all, from the military's standpoint, he was a left-winger whose closest associates, his girlfriend, wife, brother and sister-in had been and perhaps still were members Of the Communist Party. Even Oppenheimer's landlady in Berkeley was a communist. These facts would be used to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954, a public act of humiliation

**Human Computers**

- The IBM machines replaced women who used to work as human computers. Many of them were wives of physicists and engineers already working on the project.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Groves had insisted there was no more money to waste housing civilians, so many of these human computers were the wives of physicists and engineers already working on the project. But the IBM machines did not tire and had no young children to be picked up from school or nursery. The women were superseded. For now. The spring of 1944 brought unwelcome news for the scientists racing to develop a plutonium bomb. The Jewish-Italian nuclear physicist Emilio Segre, who had worked with Fermi in Rome, had uncovered a problem with samples of plutonium produced by reactors in Hanford, Washington, And Oak Ridge, Tennessee. With three graduate students, Segre had been studying the fission rates of plutonium batches in a log cabin some 14 miles from Los Alamos. Within days of receiving their first batch of reactor plutonium, the team found spontaneous fission rates to be five times higher than that from cyclotrons. As Oppenheimer had feared, a gun-type weapon made with plutonium would not work. The thin man device was abandoned. Oppenheimer's intuitive decision to call on von Neumann's expertise six months earlier now paid dividends.

**Von Neumann's View on Nuclear Arms**

- Von Neumann supported the development of nuclear arms to counter Stalin's Soviet Union.
- He feared a Soviet invasion and occupation of Japan, which he believed would give Stalin an outpost in the Pacific.

- **📚 Transcript**

  **Speaker 1**

  Von Neumann had no such qualms. His first-hand experience of Bela Kunz-Hungary and what he had seen of Nazi Germany instilled in him a horror of totalitarian dictatorship. With Germany defeated, he now felt that the greatest threat to world peace was Stalin's Soviet Union. Only the speedy and determined development of nuclear arms would keep Stalin in check. Otherwise, the war might end with the Soviet invasion and occupation of Japan, giving Stalin an outpost in the Pacific.

  Just 800 yards from ground zero in Nagasaki, Shigeko Matsumoto was one of the lucky survivors. My siblings and I played in front of the bomb shelter entrance, waited to be picked up by our grandfather, she recalls. Then, at 11.02, the sky turned bright white. My siblings and I were knocked off our feet and violently slammed back into the bomb shelter. We had no idea what had happened. As we sat there, shell-shocked and confused, heavily injured burn victims came stumbling into the bomb shelter en masse. "'Their skin had peeled off their bodies and faces and hung limply down on the ground, in ribbons. "'Their hair was burnt down to a few measly centimetres from the scalp. "'Many of the victims collapsed as soon as they reached the bomb shelter entrance, "'forming a massive pile of contorted bodies. "'The stench and heat were unbearable. My siblings and I
