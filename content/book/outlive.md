## Quotes

> “I think people get old when they stop thinking about the future,” Ric told me. “If you want to find someone’s true age, listen to them. If they talk about the past and they talk about all the things that happened that they did, they’ve gotten old. If they think about their dreams, their aspirations, what they’re still looking forward to—they’re young.”


> “To achieve our objectives, we first need to have a strategy: an overall approach, a conceptual scaffolding or mental model that is informed by science, is tailored to our goals, and gives us options. Our specific tactics flow from our strategy, and the strategy derives from our objective. We know what the objective is by now, but the strategy is the key to victory.”

> “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.
> —SUN TZU”

> “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”
> Advice George Foreman could have used.”

> “We’re trying to attack heart disease, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer’s one disease at a time, as if somehow these diseases are all unrelated to each other,” says S. Jay Olshansky, who studies the demography of aging at the University of Illinois–Chicago, “when in fact the underlying risk factor for almost everything that goes wrong with us as we grow older, both in terms of diseases we experience, and of the frailty and disability associated“with it, is related to the underlying biological process of aging.”
