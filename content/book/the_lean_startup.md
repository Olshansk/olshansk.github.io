## Overall

A fun read that I’d qualify as a classic and would recommend to some, but not
everyone. As someone who has spent a fair number of years at a startup himself,
it’s inspirational in parts, a little too obvious in others, occasionally outdated,
and often re-states “that thing” you needed to hear more often than once.

- _Must-read_: If you’ve never worked or co-founded a startup but aspiring to.
- _Maybe-read_: If you’ve been around but know you have some gaps or reminders to fill.
- _Re-read_: If you’re running or part of a startup that needs a turnaround.
- _Don’t read_: If you know what you’re doing or been around the block more than once.

One of my favorite moments from the book aligns with my strong personal belief.
Reis mentions how it's really hard to get people to steal your idea. If it’s a
world-changing idea, everyone thinks it won’t work and you have to "shove it down"
people's throats. If it’s a feature a large company could copy, the amount of work
that needs to go through selling it to management, prioritizing it on the roadmap,
and making it "perfect" is more than enough to help you validate and go to market.
Though there are exceptions to the rule, it's important to remember that they
are exceptions as long the lean startups is focused and executes on the right things.

## The Four Principles

Reis outlines

1. Smaller teams. Shift from large teams with uniform functional roles to smaller, fully engaged teams whose members take on different roles.
2. Achieve shorter cycle times.
3. Faster customer feedback, testing both whether it crashes customers’ computers and the performance of new features/customer experience.
4. Courageous decisions. Enable and empower teams to make fast and challenging decisions.

## Outdated

There were many references to specific companies, technologies or ideas which really date
the book. The analogies and references still make sense, but I think it would have been
more impactful if the references were evergreen. Here are just a few that stood out:

- Groupon: Groupon, now a zombie, was referenced as a gold standard multiple times.
- CI / CD: This is such an obvious concept nowadays, it's crazy to think it was novel AND controversial when the book was released.
- Path: I remember using an app most must've never heard of, and I learnt that they rejected a $100M offer from Google!
- Snaptax: A feature by intuit that anyone can build today in a day was considered a great and non-trivial product.
- LLMs: In general, it's crazy how old some things feel given the age of LLMs.

## The boring

There were a lot of philosophical meta takeaways which I have have both experience and heard hundreds of times (if not more). I still agree with them, but it just shows that this book is good for newcomers, is a reaosnable read for those with some startup experience, but would not recommend if you’ve been for longer than that.

## The Five Whys

- the 5 whys came from toyota manufacturing founder
- 5 whys can ve used to deduce all other lean atartup methodologies. it should be used to optimize for learning AND execution, so each startup can find the pacw it needa at the right time with a quality speed tradeofd

## Long-term stock exchange

Eric brings up the idea of a long-term stock exchange, which has since come to
fruition to some degree: ltse.com. I’m a very big fan of this idea, but in practice
I’ve seen how this can easily be circumvented via crypto. “Liquid staking” enables
staking a long-term deposit, and wherever there's a will, I can see secondary markets
creating a way.

The following excerpt is from the book that gives more details:

> In addition to quarterly reports on profits and margins, companies on the LTSE would report using innovation accounting on their intemal entrepreneurship efforts. Like Intuit, they would report on the revenue they were generating from products that did not exist a few years earlier. Executive compensation in LTSE companies would be tied to the company’s long-term performance. Trading on the LTSE would have much higher transaction costs and fees to minimize day trading and massive price swings. In exchange, LTSE companies would be allowed to structure their corporate governance to facilitate greater freedom for management to pursue long-term investments. In addition to support for long-term thinking, the transparency of the LTSE will provide valuable data about how to nurture innovation in the real world. Something like the LTSE would accelerate the creation of the next generation of great companies, built from the ground up for continuous innovation. IN CONCLUSION As a movement, the Lean Startup must avoid doctrines and rigid ideology.

## The product lifecycle

> Every successful product or feature began life in research and development (R&D), eventually became a part of the company’s strategy, was subject to optimization, and in time became old news. The problem for startups and large companies alike is that employees often follow the products they develop as they move from phase to phase. A common practice is for the inventor of a new product or feature to manage the subsequent resources, team, or division that ultimately commercializes it. As a result, strong Creative managers wind up getting stuck working on the growth and optimization of products rather than creating new ones. This tendencv is one of the reasons established companies”

## Notable Takeaways

- Startups around about turning visions into products.
- You need an appetite for risk-taking
- Measuring progress isn’t about keeping to the plan but providing value
- Missing features customers complain about is a great signal
- Speed and quality are allies in pursuit of customer needs
- Anchoring works by giving an outrageous suggestion. The compromise is closer to what you want.
- It is easier to raise revenue and money when you have zero traction and users because everything is a hypothetical
- If the goal is to see what happens, do it; it’s guaranteed to succeed.
- When you want to innovate to change the wolrd - you need to solve a human proglem
- success is solving the customers problem - not dwlivering a featurw
- real metrics vs vanity metrics
- an interesting tip he talked about is that if you're in a multi segment business where you sell to consumers and to enterprise at the same time, one tactics to have a higher list price and then have the discounted for by the sales people, but then Elizabeth has a D consumers answer running experiments and creating surf competition or issues between the Enterprise app

## Experience vs Expertise

There is a big difference between experience and expertise. There's also a big
difference between being able to lead, research, ideate, build, execute and more.
When someone can do all of the above, and have both experience and expertise, they
become an unstoppable force of nature. The following are some of the takeaways from
the book that stuck:

- Most people don't want to build a business strategy, but just build right away
- Knowing how much strategy you need before building is not easy.
- MVP requirements are not formulaic but require intuition
- Spent too much time arguing over code quality and features no one ever used
- lean thinking: provide value to the customer (doesn’t matter how its assembled, just how ti works)
- theres nothing as wrong as doing with efficiency what shouldny be done at all
- Successfully executing, a flight plan is the worst type of starting failure that you could have because you're not billing what the user actually need

## Management vs Entrepreneurship

All entrepreneurs are managers, but not all managers are entrepreneurs.
Reis touches on this more than once. A few takeaways from the book include:

- Entrepreneurship at a big company has more focus on politics & teaching
- Entrepreneurship always involves management of some sort, whether it's managing
  risk, uncertainty, people, time, money, ideas, relationships, technologies, etc...
- Strong, creative managers often get stuck in managing and optimizing commercializing
  a product rather than creating new ones

There's a lot more than what I listed above, but it's what stuck out. There's never
a right answer, and as always, the challenge is finding balance.

## Notable Quotes

> The passion, energy, and vision that people bring to these new ventures are resources too precious to waste.

> The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build — the thing customers want and will pay for — as quickly as possible.

> The Lean Startup method, in contrast, is designed to teach you how to drive a startup. Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assump tions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Through this process of steering, we can leam when and if it’s time to make a sharp turn called a pivot or whether we should persevere along our current path.

> What would an organization look like if all of its employees were armed with Lean Startup organizational superpowers? For one thing, everyone would insist that assumptions be stated explicitly and tested rigorously not as a stalling tactic or a form of make-work but out of a genuine desire to discover the truth that underlies every project’s vision

## Rough

- ability to twat wuickly is how large corps innovate
- wveeyone atruggles eoth accepting faikure and theowing things out
- need a business startegy, a roadmap, buy ij from other atakeholders, etc...
- rekove all proces or feature that does nit controbute to the learning you seek
- dont be agraid of big companies stealing your atarups idea - tey to rwsh out to the PM and theyll belvwrhwlemed anyjow. rheir job is to focus on rodmapping and execution
- search about the "myth of perseverance" in the book
- Note: focus on customer flows
- succeasful pivot: have more experiments to run
- comapny auccess is always driven by decisions from the past
- success theatre must always be stopped
- stidying: spend time with peers, experts and self
- the examples are outdated but the content is not
- humans are innatelt tallented learners when given a clear onkextive
- lots of talk about MVPs, pivots, learning and the "platfirm pivit"
- startups need periodic pivot meetings
- lean disciplinea are the core to all syccess
- single piece flow - golding one letter ag a time
