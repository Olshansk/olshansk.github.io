This book is useful and full of insightful conversations but doesn't introduce anything new if you've been immersed in the tech industry for a while. Reading articles by the likes of Paul Graham or Marc Andressen, listening to podcasts or working at large tech companies exposes you to all the concepts introduced in this book.







I MAY pick up this book again when I need to raise money, but not something I'm interested in finishing right now.
