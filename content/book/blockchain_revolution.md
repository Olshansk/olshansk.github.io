I've been following Fred Wilson's newsletter for a little while now and have had a growing interest in blockchain technology. I was really excited about this book to learn about all its intricacies and applications, but was sorely disappointed. There are very few books I don't finish, and this is one of them...







The writing is wordy, superfluous, and draws analogies from a lot of different historical characters and events for no apparent reason. Sometimes I feel like the author did so just to showcase the breadth of his knowledge. It was extremely repetitive, and could easily be shortened by at least half.







There is very little discussion on how the blockchain actually works. The book simply idealizes a future world with blockchain at the heart of everything. Rather than evaluating the pros and cons of taking this approach, it feels like the book is just spreading propaganda. However, it is probably my fault for picking up a book that has "Revolution" in the title.







I would recommend to avoid this book. If you're really determined thought, picking it up and reading any one random chapter would more than suffice to get a feel for the overall idea.
