## Overall

I made it 20% through the book and do not plan to finish it.

I personally believe that anyone who has been exposed to academia in any way,
even if just through films, would not get much out of this book. I do not
recommend it to anyone.

The message delivered by the author is informed important. However, it is delivered
in an un-engaging, long-winded, repetitive, conceptual way. I feel that this book
would be much more impactful if it were simply be a 20 minute TED talk,
focused on the numbers, graphs and charts.
