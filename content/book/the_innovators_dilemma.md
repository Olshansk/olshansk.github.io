Solid book.







Overall, it felt a little repetitive and outdated. I'd personally be interested in hearing more about the case studies over the past 10 years. That being studied, I'm a big believer that even though history doesn't repeat itself, it does rhyme, so there are a lot of useful takeaways from the case studies explored in the book.







My guess is that the book's thesis was a lot more "original" in the 90s where entrepreneurship, VC investments, spinoffs, and startups were just getting started; or at least far from how popular they are today. However, the thesis holds 100% true: the only way to innovate is to tackle small markets with a startup mindset. It's no secret that a startup trying to apply a waterfall approach to a market that doesn't exist probably won't succeed...
