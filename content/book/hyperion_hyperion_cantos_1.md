This is the first book I've read by Dan Simmons and I've got to say that it's simply amazing! Horror, sci-fi, thriller, detective-fiction, and many other genres that I'm not even going to try and list are all contained and very well connected within this one book!







Every chapter takes you on a new journey, an utter change of pace, as new characters are introduced for whom you sympathize, or whom you love, hate, respect or miss. So many different themes are covered that it would be blasphemous to generalize the message of this book without analyzing small subsections of every chapter.







Whichever section I read governed how I felt and thought for the rest of the day. Whether it was the adrenaline pump of an exciting action sequence, questioning one's faith and place in this world, or simply trying to appreciate the poetry of the past.







I also applaud Dan Simmons for setting up this book in such a way where he could showcase his ability to write in many different styles, each of which he succeeded at.







Can't wait to hit the next three books in the series!
