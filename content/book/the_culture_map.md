A very well written and applicable book to anyone who works in a multicultural organization. A must read for anyone works in tech in my opinion.







It was very relatable and full of fun and informative anecdotes rather than just introducing high level concepts.







As someone who grew up moving from one country to another, I'm very impressed that someone who was born and raised in Missouri was able to gain so much insight in cross-cultural differenceces.







Full review coming soon.
