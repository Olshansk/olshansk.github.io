## Overall

Practical, fun, real and to the point. I plan to recommend this as a MUST READ
and a FIRST READ for anyone who ever asks me on "how to start a business."

I enjoy my current "day job", and though I'm not a co-founder, I very much see
myself as one here. Going into this book, my goal was not to escape it, but to learn
new tips and reinforce existing ones to be as successful in it as I can day-to-day.

Even when applied to an existing company, the "new project" mindset is really useful
in challenging whether what you're doing day-to-day is what you actually need to
be doing to either save, grow or expand the company. I also have side project ideas
on an almost weekly basis, so I thought it'd be a fun opportunity to see what I
could improve to actually get one of them off the ground. Here's the latest one:

## Noah's Backstory

If you've been around the Bay Area long enough, you most likely have met someone
who either became very successful, missed or passed on an opportunity to be very
successful, failed horribly, and everything in between. Whenever things don't go
as planned, it usually accompanied by disappointment, stress, frustration and anxiety.
Hearing Noah's backstory made me reflect how I would've felt in his shoes...

In the mid 2000s, he had an internship at Microsoft but was not offered a full-time
position. He got an offer from Google, but it was rescinded. He was employee 30
at Facebook, but was fired a few months before hitting hit one year clif and
vesting 0.06% of the company.

Noah also goes into how he father was an Israeli immigrant and never afraid to
ask and get rejected. As an Israeli immigrant myself, with a very similar father,
I could relate.

## My key takeaways on how do succeed?

My biggest takeaway is to just ask the obvious question and then do the obvious
thing. Fear and overthinking are the biggest obstacles to success. A lot of
it has to do with the [Hawthorne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect)
and external pressures which makes use start to question ourselves, but all we
need to do to succeed is just eliminate that.

- Continue trying more and more things until you succeed.
- Have fun trying to succeed, at least most of the time.
- Focus on the first dollar and don't be afraid to get your ass kicked.
- Remember that customers want solutions, not ideas
- Remember that all multi-billion dollar companies start with personal human connections
- Solve your own problems
- Whenever you hit a new daily problem, jot it down

## Actionable Advice

- Find your 1000 true fans
- Build your first 1000 true fans by finding a niche within a niche and connecting with them
- Ask friends for referrals with a ton of detail but followup by saying "no pressure"
- For marketing emails - start with "You're awesome"
- Add a subscribe button to your landing page
- The power of text (email, blogs, etc) lies in the power of having a high quality connection between the author and the reader
- Have fun when you're selling!
- You need to get comfortable with selling BEFORE the product exists. Discounts, future features, markets, etc...
- Use google trends and facebook ads to validate your ideas and market size

## Taking Photos

At one point in the book, Noah talks about a college experiment where students
had one of two options:

1. Get graded based on the quality of 1 amazing photo
2. Get graded based on the overall quality of 100 okay photos

The second group ended up getting much better grades not only because taking
"the perfect photo" is hard, but because they weren't afraid to try things out
and experiment. They did so much of it, that by the end, the quality of their
100th photos was higher than the "perfect photo" of the first group which
was obsessing over all the details.
