I listened to this book over the course of 2 days while driving from Mountain View, CA to Seatle, WA and absolutely LOVED it. Given the format of the audiobook where there is discussion in between chapters, I really do believe this is one of those books that you should listen to rather than read.







This warrants a much longer (in progress) article where I detail out the challenges listed out and how I plan to tackle them, so stay tuned for that.
