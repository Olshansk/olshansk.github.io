A short, great, motivational read about what creates a good company, the state of technology in the world, as well as the prime characteristics required from successful founders. It’s great to hear a successful entrepreneur’s perspective and impression of the world, directly from him, in what comes across as very candid and honest mindset. His writing is extremely succinct, so the book turns into a light and fast read that never gets boring or repetitive.







Reading this book a couple years after it was published is very interesting because everything Peter says and all the company’s he referenced are still extremely relevant but a  critical view of the book’s future, and today’s present, allows the reader to be more critical of his predictions.







"Twitter already has more than 250 million users today. It doesn’t need to add too many customized features in order to acquire more, and there’s no inherent reason why it should ever stop growing.” Even though this sounds true, it’s unfortunate how twitter is one of the company’s struggling most from user growth now days.







"The Chinese public, too, knows that winter is coming.” Peter both called it and made a game of thrones reference at the same time.
