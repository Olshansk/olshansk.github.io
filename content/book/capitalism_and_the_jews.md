I threw in the towel on this book after making it approximately a quarter of the way through. It is very bloated, repetitive, and has a bad mix of providing uninteresting details and a poor holistic perspective. The reason I gave this book 2 stars rather than 1 is because I could see myself potentially coming back to it in the future when I am at a different point in my life.







As a Capistlit and a Jew, I was intrigued by the title and wanted to see what the book had to offer. I was looking to learn something new and perhaps change my perspective.







However, the book delves into random uninteresting details. For example, the author spent several pages discussing the types of words Karl Marx used to describe Jews and how that affected the public's perception of them. I did not find it to be a very interesting perspective because there are many people who use a multitude of words to describe various groups of people, so this was just a very specific example of one person saying a few things about a very specific group of people. All races, religions, and groups experience the same problems.







Some historical reasons for why Jews historically managed money is because lending money was considered a sin in Catholicism. This is interesting but was delivered via a very mundane and uninteresting manner in the book.







Overall, I think that reading the wiki page on Economic Antisemithism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_antisemitism) is a better use of time than reading this book.
