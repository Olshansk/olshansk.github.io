Soon to come.







EDIT: Someone recently asked me about my thoughts on this book, and I realize I never published a review. The set of notes below is what I jotted down in 2019 (unedited, with typos, etc.) and am posting here, for completeness, in 2022.







----------







I didn't feel like I was Learning by listening to doomsday scenarios



- more than half of all global emissions in the last 30 decades



- 200mm people on earth during Roman empire. 200mmm will be evicted by 2100 due to climate. Bad reference



- Draws a blooming tale of 8 degrees warming followed by a paper that states that environment is actually less sense to r to carbon than we thought. Climate less sense I've to.emissions. 5 degrees is a. Ear worst case



- Heat waves



- Lots of natural disasters Ina short time period



- Animals dying



- Some parts of getting too warm



- Different leaf colours



- Huber nation patterns of hairs change



- Random stats about cost of each degree of global warming. He's saying no economic growth (steady state economics) of temperature grows Hy four degrees by 2100 - bullshit



- He mentioned carbon capture or geonerring solution that'll result in a "grim" situation rather than apocalyptic. I would argue that science always has unexpected innovations



- "a simple.change to the butcoin algorithm" could eliminate butcoin footprint entirely. This person needs to be fact checked like hell



- He says things like "warmest temperature ever records", but we haven't been recording data for all that long
