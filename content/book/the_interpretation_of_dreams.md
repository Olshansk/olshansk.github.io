Discretion: I only got about 30% into the book.







My expectations going into this book were relatively high seeing how it is a classic, and I expected it to stand the test of time. Unfortunately, it did not…







A friend of mine recommended it after saying that it changed her perspective to life, and how it impacted the decisions she makes on a day-to-day basis by analyzing her dreams. While there is some merit to the fact that dreams can be used to analyze one’s subconscious, I believe the idea is overdone and unnecessary for those who have a high degree of self-awareness.







The idea of dream interoperation was probably novel in 1899, when the book first came out, but the concept that dreams are a partial representation of an individual’s unconscious mind is has become such a major part of social mode and pop culture, that it’s nothing new. Prior to this book, some religious organizations or tribes might have seen dreams as messages from religious deities, but this was the first “scientific” approach to dream analysis. I used the term “scientific” very loosely, because it is a collection of anecdotal cases rather than large scale studies.







There were a few interesting points made throughout the first third of the book, but I didn’t find it interesting enough to stick with it.







=== Cool notes/facts I took away from the book ===







History



- People used to think that dreams were a way of supernatural beings trying to communicate with us



- Dream analysis dates back to Aristotle, who wrote to pieces of work on the human psyche related to dreams



- There was an interesting quote that said “Nature is demonic, not divine”







Physical sense while sleeping



- Dreams are affected by both physiological and psychological factors



- Physiological effects are exhilarated while one is sleeping



- A sound, a light, a touch are over-intensified



- A drop of water makes you think you drowned



- Slight heating of the body while the person is sleeping results in burning during dream



- There was a case where something fell on someone’s neck while sleeping, which resulted in decapitation in the dream



- The most interesting point here is the time dilation. A whole universe had to be created that led to the decapitation in that instant.



- Time dilation in dreams is very interesting!







Dream meaning



- It is not uncommon for dreams to be representative of events from the previous day or from years ago



- Dreams where everyone else is a giant are most likely related to a memory from childhoof







Falling Asleep



- Sleep happens as a result of a lack of stimuli. However, it depends what one is accustomed to.



- For example, light is okay for those who don't like darkness



- Dreams are forgotten quickly and won’t be remembered unless we write things down immediately







Knowledge in dreams



- There was a dream where some knew the name of a plant, but he didn't know how (the lizard dream). This happens because we subconsciously interact with content around us, and somehow process it even if we weren’t aware of it
