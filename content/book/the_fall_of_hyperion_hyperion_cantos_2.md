The Fall of Hyperion is an enthralling work of art that could not have been done any better as a follow-up to the captivating world of Hyperion.







Dan Simmons applies a myriad of science fiction concepts and ideas that will fulfill all of your sci-fi cravings. Intergalactic battles between humans and gods. Time travel. Resurrection. Abstract planes and dimensions. A varied and very finely molded set of characters that are solid, smart, quirky, empathetic and very complex. The characters learn, grow and flourish, losing or developing their earlier distinguishable characteristics, and the readers are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to join them on this journey.







Whilst sci-fi and fantasy hold the core of this plot, there are a lot of political, dystopic, and religious issues as well. This book provides a well crafted answer to Abraham's complex, without making love sound cheesy. It also sets the stage for a battle of the gods without making it feel forced or overwhelming. All the events that take place, regardless of how grand or how minor are necessary and fit perfectly into place.







Looking forward to reading the next book in the Hyperion Cantos!
