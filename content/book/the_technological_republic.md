## Overall Thoughts & Summary

I have huge admiration for the work Palantir does, tons of respect for Alex Karp, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.

This is the sort of book you're likely to pick up only if you already align with the author's views, and the company culture.
I got about a quarter of the way through and would have much rather read a "blinkist summary" of the book and listened to
an a podcast with Alex Karp instead.

When I read books, I look to learn something new, be inspired by someone's biography, be challenged by
a different perspective, or be drawn into a new world. This simply felt like an echo chamber that reinforced my views.

I interviewed at Palantir in 2014 and would have accepted the offer had I gotten one.
I interviewed with their CTO at the time, and thought it went well, I didn't jive with hiring manager as much.
Though they reached back out to me in 2016, I was on a different journey at that point.

All this is to say is that I've been excited about and aligned with the company's vision and direction since the start.

Alex Karp discusses the importance of innovation in hard tech: defense, military, science, etc... He pushes back on the
"woke culture" that took over Silicon Valley in the 2010s where tons of brilliant minds would work on ads, get mental
health days every other week, complain about how the company's lack of involvement in some political movement, and feel
entitled to be paid a premium compensation package even though they say money doesn't matter.

Fortunately, there has been a huge mindset shift in the past few years, and Palantir has been pushing for it for over a decade.

I'd love the opportunity to work with Karp's leadership team. I'm excited to keep seeing the company grow and thrive.
I'm impressed by what they have achieved with Foundry. I'm inspired by their action's, vision, direction, values and culture.

With all of that said, I did not like the book and would not recommend it to others.
