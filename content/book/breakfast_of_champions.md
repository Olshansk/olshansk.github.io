Breakfast of Champions is Vonnegut's somewhat cynical view and interpretation of American culture. However, more than that, this book was an inside look into Vonnegut's character. With this book, he did what he wanted, he expressed what he thought, and wrote what he dreamed of. Though I wouldn't say that it was one of his best pieces of writing, it was definitely a great read if you're a fan of his other work. And so on.
