A quick and easy read that was relevant two years ago, but already begins to feel a little dated and will probably not stand the test of time.







If you work in the tech industry, are a tech enthusiast, or at least try to keep up with how such innovative companies function, this book will not deliver any eye-opening messages. This was a more technical take on 1984 that referenced existing companies and thus felt more true to reality. However, only 2 years later, the concept of a self-driving car which was mentioned in the book is not that surprising at all anymore.







The book felt very superficial, repetitive and failed to make me feel connected to the protagonist. It's as if the main character knew I was watching her and was afraid to let me see her true self. I felt very distant and unsatisfied reading that.







That being said, the book has a great premise and a great plot. About halfway through, it really captivated me since there were a couple unanswered questions and events were unwrapping ever more quickly, so I just couldn't stop reading. As a purely entertaining chain of events, this book does a great job at introducing the characters and atmosphere, introducing an element of mystery, building up to the climactic scene, and culminating in an unexpected way.







Overall, it feels more like something that should be watched as a film rather than be read as a book.
