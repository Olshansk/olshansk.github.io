**tl;dr, in 2022:**



1. 10% is a must-read that people will look back on as the recipes of modern life (first two chapters)



2. 10% is a timeless reference that I can see myself listening back to periodically every few years (last two chapters)



3. 80% is a good reference but will likely be outdated or superseded by better text in the next 1-2 decades (everything else)

1.







The fact that Tony Robbins fixed his rotator cuff with stem cells in 3 days without surgery and rehab is hard to believe, but I guess it's where things are going and we'll see with time.







As someone who is dealing with a herniated disc, I have asked several surgeons about this who have all been telling me that it works great for joins & tendons, but there isn't enough evidence for herniations yet.







Anecdotely, I have a friend who has a microdiscectomy that re-herniated and was planning on getting a second one. He decided to try out stem cells, and though he had no results for 3 months, he later woke up one day and was completely healed.







2.







The last couple of chapters, narrated by Tony himself, are timeless. Everything related to attitude, gratitude and mindfulness is timeless, and I think I will grow to appreciate it more and more every time I listen to it. At the time of writing this, I plan to listen back to those last two chapters every couple of years.







3.







Most of the center of the book is more a reference than anything that's SUPER captivating or exciting. I've heard a lot of the concepts in various podcasts, but still managed to learn a lot of new things. I think it's worth listening to but wouldn't call it a must. Knowing the chapter names and using it as a reference is worth it.

The only thing that bothers me a bit, which was raised to me by a friend, is that Tony does have a vested financial interest in a lot of the companies and products he touted. He discloses all of his investments but sometimes says, "This product is unlike any other, and that is why I decided to invest." There was a product (whose name now escapes me) related to using ultrasound to help with pain. Upon searching for a clinic that supports this, I learned it's extremely proprietary technology only available in one clinic in the US. He made it sound like a commonplace medical procedure, which felt misleading.
