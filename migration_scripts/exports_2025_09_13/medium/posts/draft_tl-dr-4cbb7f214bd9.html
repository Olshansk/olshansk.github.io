Later, financials and governing structures of crypto-native projects become much more complex.

The more hype and marketing you can create around a token, the more runway you have.</p><p name="9003" id="9003" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is great, but it’s a double-edged sword. You immediately become a public company where VCs can realize gains or losses, and you become beholden to ensure a return for both institutional and retail investors. These investors become part of your open decentralized community, creating noise, craving attention, but are critical to spreading the word, attracting users, sustaining token price and lengthening the project’s runway. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Just ignore the noise and focus”</em> is great advice, but <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“the noise”</em> is part of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“core and soul”</em> of an open decentralized community.</p><p name="02d5" id="02d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I interned at Twitter before it went public and joined them full-time shortly after they IPOed.

You announce partnerships to build credibility, but the underlying substance doesn’t really matter. Maybe you’ll even announce that there’s an announcement coming out about an announcement in a week from now, that’ll get some ❤️.

They’re deep thinkers, genuinely motivated to do great work, execute like there’s no tomorrow, and give off positive vibes. Prior to joining crypto, conferences felt more like a way to leverage the corporate budget for a free trip. In crypto, I genuinely make life-long friends.</p><p name="d918" id="d918" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mentioned how we need marketing, liquidity and memes to make this work, so here’s another one:</p><figure name="4f40" id="4f40" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*GHTHwlSgMZbjVgLQ.png" data-width="675" data-height="499" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GHTHwlSgMZbjVgLQ.png"></figure><h3 name="3eec" id="3eec" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The Reason I’m Still Around</h3><p name="c1ed" id="c1ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I recently did a panel moderated by a general partner at a16z crypto. When we spoke after the panel, he said something along the lines of: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“[The services your project provides] is only cheaper because token speculation is financing it.”</strong> Today, he’s completely right. In the future, I want to prove him wrong.</p><p name="5c4b" id="5c4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Around the same time, I had a conversation with a senior executive of emerging technologies at Cloudflare. He’s open minded to crypto’s potential, but I got the sense that there needs to be more signal before he’s convinced. I want to show that we can find a signal.</p><p name="a984" id="a984" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Vertically integrated systems will always be more efficient, performant and cost effective. Decentralized for the decentralization is unnecessary. However, if a system is both permissionless and sufficiently incentivized, it’s level of decentralization will adapt to what the market needs, even if it’s just an N-of-1. This comes at a cost, but when individuals are willing to pay that cost, we’ll have found the signal.</p><p name="a240" id="a240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You hear about progressive decentralization, but I like to take a more pragmatic approach to things:</p><figure name="a287" id="a287" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*OqPUrSCgVn_dhZrE.png" data-width="1456" data-height="774" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OqPUrSCgVn_dhZrE.png"></figure><p name="a384" id="a384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For better or worse, I also feel a sense of responsibility to provide an ROI not just for our investors, but also community members (i.e. retail investors) with whom the project wouldn’t succeed. Same goes for my friends and family who chose to invest money in the space simply because I am there.</p><p name="668c" id="668c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I recently took on the role of CTO at Grove. Why? Because I believe what Google did with Kubernetes for the cloud, we can do with Pocket Network for crypto. I’ll write more on this in a future post.</p><p name="f072" id="f072" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In parallel to writing this blog post, I listened to Uri Levine’s (founder of Waze) book <a href="https://urilevine.com/book/" data-href="https://urilevine.com/book/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fall In Love with the Problem, Not the Solution</a>. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">While crypto does sometimes feel like a hammer looking for a nail, I know speak for many when I say that we fell in love with this problem: “There’s something big here. How do we make it a reality?”.</strong></p></div></div></section><section name="52e2" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="dcaa" id="dcaa" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">If you actually made it all the way to the end, please subscribe!
