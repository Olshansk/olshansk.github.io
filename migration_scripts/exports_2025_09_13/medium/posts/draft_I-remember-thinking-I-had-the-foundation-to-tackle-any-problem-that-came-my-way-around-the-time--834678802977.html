Our guess to this date is that the current drawn by the car’s battery exceeded what the jump start battery was able to supply.</p><p name="cb08" id="cb08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, the neighbours managed to find their jump-start cables and my friend used his rental car to jump-start my own. We were finally on our way home!</p><h3 name="647a" id="647a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Postmortem</h3><h3 name="df25" id="df25" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Cause</h3><p name="4e93" id="4e93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Since all the lights were off, I still don’t know what caused the battery to discharge. My best guess is that one of the doors was left unlocked, triggering some module in the car to run all night.</p><p name="1446" id="1446" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After doing some research, it seems that most new cars are moving away from having mechanical modes of interaction. I can completely understand that eliminating secondary input methods can simplify the overall design and maintenance, but there needs to be a backup plan… In theory, I understand that this solves 99% of user cases, but there could be unrecoverable errors in practice. What if I was stuck in the middle out of the desert without reception?</p><h3 name="3b24" id="3b24" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cost</h3><p name="3e06" id="3e06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Most of the people had already left when this happened, and only 7 remained. The whole ordeal took about 2 hours to figure out, along with a $7 cost for the key fob batteries. Not that bad but also avoidable.</p><h3 name="fab5" id="fab5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Ideas</h3><p name="298c" id="298c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Aside from having secondary mechanical modes of operation, an idea I had is that car manufacturers could install a small secondary backup battery (similar to the jump start battery I bought) under the vehicle’s hood. The battery would be off by default to avoid parasitic discharge if you accidentally left your light on and could be turned on by toggling a physical switch. I later learnt that most batteries operate in the 550mA-650mA range and only need 50mA-100mA to start the car. So if the secondary backup battery could provide this much current, the vehicle would be able to charge itself!</p><h3 name="d05e" id="d05e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Actions I’ve taken</h3><p name="6b31" id="6b31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Some of the actions I’ve taken as a result of this event are:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="3fc5" id="3fc5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Keep an extra key fob battery inside the car.</li><li name="b80a" id="b80a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Keep the jumper cables and jump-start battery under one of the seats inside the car.</li><li name="457d" id="457d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Thinking about what my next car should be.</li></ol><p name="543d" id="543d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">A few other things I keep in my car for any potential future events are:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="7812" id="7812" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">First aid kit</li><li name="9405" id="9405" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Toothbrush &amp; toothpaste</li><li name="1e4b" id="1e4b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Water &amp; snacks</li><li name="3d32" id="3d32" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Pepper spray</li><li name="15b4" id="15b4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Tissue and toilet paper</li><li name="e63c" id="e63c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A rope</li></ul><p name="2c11" id="2c11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Bring it on, world.

But, in practice, without the experience of having gone through this or hearing it from someone else, I don’t think I could have prepared for this unfortunate series of events.</p><p name="50c0" id="50c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the worse case, we could have called Geico roadside assistance, but it would have taken longer and been a bit of a hassle. All-in-all, we lost a couple of hours, but I learnt something and now have a memorable experience with my friends.</p><p name="19fc" id="19fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This whole situation resonates well with how I feel at work. Reading, building, studying and preparing are fun and necessary, but some things can only be learnt through experience, which can sometime be stressful but also what gets me excited every single day.</p></div></div></section>
