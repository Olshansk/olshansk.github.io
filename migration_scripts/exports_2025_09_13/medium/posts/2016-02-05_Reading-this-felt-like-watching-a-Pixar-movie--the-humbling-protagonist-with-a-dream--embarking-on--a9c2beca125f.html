You should legitimately consider selling the rights to your story.</p><p name="dfa3" id="dfa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You said your goal was to tell a story through dance, and in a way you managed to do it by writing this piece. Your passion for the art and the candidness of your words took me on a wilder emotional rollercoaster than I had originally expected.</p><p name="a0af" id="a0af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Congrats on taking initiative to follow your dream, and for staying positive even when stumbling across some very challenging hurdles. It was a pleasure to read. I can’t wait to hear what’s coming next!</p></div></div></section>
