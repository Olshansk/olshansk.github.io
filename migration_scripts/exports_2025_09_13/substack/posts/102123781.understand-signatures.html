<p>I recently came by this <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/56195/shor-algorithm-and-schnorr-signature-in-ed25519/56197#56197">stack exchange</a></p><p></p><blockquote><p>Shor's algorithm can compute discrete logs in elliptic curves and thereby recover the secret scalar from a public Ed25519 key, which you can use to forge signatures of your choice.</p><p>So, yes, it affects Ed25519â€”it completely breaks Ed25519, or it would if you could engineer a quantum computer capable of executing it.</p><p>It can also compute discrete logs in finite fields, which you can use to forge traditional finite-field Schnorr signatures.</p></blockquote><p>What are discrete logs?</p><p>What are finite fields?</p><p>What are schnorr signatures?</p>
