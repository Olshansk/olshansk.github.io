I want to set a certain direction a vision while again find some problems and then build a team around that vision and around the Russian, how we operate as we go and talk it. because I have my own preferences, of how to work. There's certain problems that I want to tackle, and I want to decide how we tackle them, and I don't think I would it takes to be a solo founder because there's a lots of gaps in my scalef sets, but I do want to be a co founder and get people very compimentary. Skill sets for it. You know, when I think about just coming very early, I realize that I need to work in a way where I can't say that a company can or cannot succeed without me, but where I at least, early on, they won't succeed without me, but eventually, they'll succeed differently whether or not I'm there once we pass a certain threshold or activation energy. So putting all of those together, I'm going to be joining someone really, really early. I need to be really, really aligned on the values and the culture and the operating structure. And I have to embody the direction and the vision and the excitment just as much as the founders. But if it's me and my early partners, then we'll go and get it together with very complementary skill sets. And putting all of those together, I really don't see a different direction right now.</p>
