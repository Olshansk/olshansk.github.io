If you wanted to work on these ‘harder’ areas of the economy but also wanted a Silicon Valley work culture, Palantir was basically your only option for awhile.</p><p>Though I went to Twitter, I ended up spending most of my pre startup time at Waymo and Magic Leap, but that’s a story for another day.</p><p>&gt; Talent density: These were seriously intense, competitive people who wanted to win, true believers; weird, fascinating people who read philosophy in their spare time, went on weird diets, and did 100-mile bike rides for fun</p><p>I remember when this was cool.</p><p>&gt;&nbsp; Peter Thiel and Max Levchin were extremely intense people - hyper-competitive, hard-working, and unwilling to accept defeat.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I’ve had it but it comes and wanes. You need to really believe in the vision to make it happen.</p><p>&gt; Alex Kari’s approach to interviews is awesome</p><p>&gt; This is hard to LARP - your founders and early employees have to be genuinely interesting intellectual thinkers.</p><p>&gt; FDE</p><p>Not a common model in tech startups, and it’s cool how it shapes the foundry product.</p><p>I personally think this is going to be a good evolution given LLMs, but will save that for a different post.</p><p>&gt; Viewed this way, Palantir pulled off a rare services company → product company pivot: in 2016, descriptions of it as a Silicon Valley services company were not totally off the mark, but in 2024 they are deeply off the mark, because the company successfully built an enterprise data platform using the lessons from those early years, and it shows in the gross margins - 80% gross margins in 2023. These are software margins. Compare to Accenture: 32%.</p><p>The Palantir I applied too is very different from the Palantir today&nbsp;</p><p>&gt; but it also meant an intense decade-long learning cycle which eventually paid off.</p><p>To be frank, this is one of those “seems obvious in hindsight” sort of situations.</p><p>&gt; FDEs tend to write code that gets the job done fast, which usually means – politely – technical debt and hacky workarounds</p><p>Seen it. Done it.</p><p>&gt; The world needs more companies like SpaceX, and Palantir, that differentiate on <em>execution</em> - achieving the outcome - not on playing political games or building narrow point solutions that don’t hit the goal.</p><p>&gt; As a rationalist-brained philosophy graduate, this particular point was deeply important to me – I wasn’t interested in joining an uncritical cult. But a cult of skeptical people who cared deeply and wanted to argue about where the world was going and how software fit into it – existentially – that was interesting to me.</p><p>I read Ray Dalia’s principles when it first came out. Going to read every other book on that list. Genuinely excited for it.</p><p>Consider turning this into a full-on blog post. Say it was meant to be just a note. Go into how my blog post with my dad evolved.</p><p>&gt; Tyler cohen on ISMs from different people.</p><p>What if I ask various people on Olshanskyisms</p><ul><li><p>Please update comment</p></li><li><p>Make it simpler</p></li><li><p>No hi</p></li><li><p>I don’t get it</p></li><li><p>I don’t like to be confused</p></li><li><p>This is very nuanced</p></li></ul><p>&gt; all of them <em>regularly</em> coin memes. It turns out that this is a good proxy for impact.</p><p>People literally refer to me as the chief naming officer at grove.</p><p>&gt; Better to just give everyone the same title and make them go focus on the goal instead.</p><p>Makes sense. This is necessary to avoid middle management, but leadership is still necessary.&nbsp; You need C level execs for leadership, direction, intuition and calling the shots.</p><p>&gt; The cost of this was that the company often felt like there was no clear strategy or direction, more like a Petri dish of smart people building little fiefdoms and going off in random directions</p><p>If I read this, I’d say there’s no chance it’ll work out.</p><p>&gt; somebody would be very influential for awhile, then mysteriously disappear and not be working on anything visible for months, and you wouldn’t ever be totally sure what happened.</p><p>This is just weird.</p><p>&gt; Palantir had several differentiated sources of recruiting alpha.</p><p>I love the phrasing in this entire blog post. He’s killing it.</p><p>&gt; Palantir was the only real ‘beacon’ for these types, and the company was loud about supporting the military, being patriotic, and so on, when that was deeply unfashionable.</p><p>I guess that’s why it was my first choice.</p><p>&gt; All of this selected for a certain type of person: somebody who can think for themselves, and doesn’t over-index on a bad news story.</p><p>I never understood the negativity. I just found more interesting things later.</p><p>&gt; But my claim here is that the grey area is worth engaging in too: work on government AI policy. Deploy AI into areas like healthcare. Sure, it’ll be difficult. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/existential-risk-and-the-turn-in-human-history.html">Plunge in</a>.8</p><p>I’ll be honest. This is probably not something I’d ever risk spending time on.</p><p>&gt; in industries like manufacturing, defense, logistics, healthcare and more.</p><p>Everyone is sleeping in construction.</p><p>&gt; There’s something to this correlation: by making the company about something other than making money (civil liberties; AI god) you attract true believers from the start, who in turn create the highly generative intellectual culture that persists once you eventually find success</p><p>This is what crypto once was.</p><p>&gt; As Byrne Hobart notes in his <a href="https://www.thediff.co/archive/palantir-on-business-cults-and-politics/">deeply perceptive piece about the company</a>, <em>“Cult” is just a euphemism for “ability to pay below-market salaries and get above-average worker retention.”</em> This is also fair – the company paid lower than market salaries, and it was common to stick around for 5+ years. That said, most early employees did very well, thanks to the performance of the stock. But it was not obvious that we <em>would</em> do well; most of us had mentally written off the value of our equity, especially during the toughest years. I vividly remember there was one of those ‘explaining the value of your equity’ pamphlets that showed the value of the equity if the company was valued at $100bn, and a group of us laughing about the hubris of that. The company is, as of writing, at $97.4 billion.</p><p>There’s so much to unpack there.</p><p>—-</p><p>Call out this was the one thing I read on my flight from Toronto to New York City.</p>
