<p>I recently had the fortune of stumbling upon a transcript from a 1986 seminar by Richard Hamming at the Bell Communications Research Colloquium titled ‚Äú<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">You and Your Research</a>.‚Äù If you‚Äôre ever looking for inspiration, this is it.</p><p>A key point Hamming emphasizes is that when reading, it's not the quantity but the quality that matters: <em>"you read, it is not the amount, it is the way you read that counts."</em> To showcase active reading, you can find my <em>Proof of Active Reading</em> <strong><a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3.olshansky.info/YouandYourResearchReview.pdf">here</a></strong> or at ipfs://bafybeifoz5tkbdd2v5bzxfuyvokuchnpoqthl63gwcuoadmmz3c7t5kfve.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>"<em>Now, why is this talk important? I think it is important because, as far as I know, each of you has one life to live."</em></p><p>Although nearly 37 years old and originally aimed at scientists and researchers, Hamming's talk remains relevant for innovators and builders today. He began his career programming IBM computers at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project and later spent decades at Bell Labs conducting computer science research, lecturing at various universities, and receiving numerous awards, including the Turing Award. Hamming worked alongside 20th-century legends such as Shannon, Feynman, Oppenheimer, Fermi, and Teller. This talk distills his learnings on innovation from decades of personal experience and observation of the best in the field.</p><p>Amidst the plethora of books, podcasts, and content on how to build and innovate in today's world, much of it might seem familiar. However, Hamming's perspective and experience, which date back several decades before the modern startup boom, are invaluable. I personally believe this talk is timeless and essential reading for any innovator navigating today's economy.</p><h1>Significant and Forgotten Contributions</h1><p><em>"I became very interested in the difference between those who do and those who might have done."</em></p><p>Hamming's central theme is understanding why some scientists make significant contributions while others fade into obscurity. Although his focus is on scientific work, this idea applies across various fields and professions.</p><p>Countless brilliant and hard-working individuals populate both startups and large corporations, yet only a few have a truly profound impact. The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a></strong> (aka the 80/20 rule) is just as relevant in the mid-20th-century scientific community as it is in today's world.</p><p>While working at Bell Labs, Hamming asked his lunch buddies about the important problems they were working on. His question was not well-received, and as he said, "I wasn't welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with!" Unsurprisingly, their work never made significant contributions or had a profound impact on the industry.</p><p>In contrast, those willing to ask big questions, such as "What will be the role of computers in all of AT&amp;T?", were the ones who spearheaded the computing and information revolutions.</p><h1>Working with the System</h1><p><em>"It is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it."</em></p><p>The importance of building and selling a product is well-known in the tech world, so it was refreshing to see this perspective from a physicist in the 80s. Hamming argued that if no one reads your work, regardless of its quality, you won't receive credit and no one will care.</p><p>Hamming devoted considerable time to discussing the delicate balance of working within a system. Constantly fighting the system leads nowhere, but never challenging it confines you to its limits. Instead, create in a way that others within the system can build upon, pushing boundaries just enough without tearing them down.</p><p>Hamming also emphasized the importance of effective communication, requiring mastery of various skills. One must write clearly, both concisely and expansively. Presentations should be delivered both formally and informally. Although many talks fail due to excessive detail, there is a time and place for those as well.</p><p>An interesting tidbit he shared was that Darwin documented every piece of contradictory evidence during his research to ensure it would not be forgotten.</p><h1>Open Mind</h1><p><em>"Luck favors the prepared mind."</em></p><p>Striking a delicate balance in maintaining an open mind is crucial. Believing too strongly in your work blinds you to its flaws, while excessive doubt prevents progress.</p><p>Hamming discussed the importance of change. The most successful individuals he encountered shifted their focus every seven years. For example, though Shannon is best known for his contributions to information theory, he also spent considerable time (less successfully) working in genetics. Changing focus allows for fresh ideas and bridges concepts across different fields, where true innovation occurs. The only change I‚Äôd make to his statement, from a discussion I was having with a friend, is that four years is more appropriate than seven years given how quickly things move today.</p><p>Lastly, Hamming considered the open-door vs. closed-door dilemma. Those with an open-door policy face more distractions and accomplish less in the short term. In contrast, those with a closed-door policy achieve more in the short term but risk falling behind or working on irrelevant problems if the door remains closed for too long. Once again, balance is essential.</p><h1>First Class Work</h1><p><em>"Doing really first-class work, and knowing it, is as good as wine, women and song put together."</em></p><p>The first step to doing first-class work is addressing important problems. The second step involves having an original idea. Finally, recognize that ideal working conditions are dynamic, never quite as expected, and vary with each situation.</p><p>Hamming emphasized the significance of achieving and celebrating small successes. This is not merely for the sake of iteration, but for the confidence and courage it instills in individuals and teams to tackle larger problems.</p><p>First-class work demands creativity, which arises from a rested subconscious mind. Even after nearly 40 years, our understanding of the subconscious remains limited, but the importance of rest is undisputed. The subconscious needs sufficient context to solve a problem, but it must also be left undisturbed.</p><p>My favorite part was when Hamming quoted Newton: <em>"If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results."</em></p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p><em>‚ÄúUNIX was never a deliverable.‚Äù</em></p><p>A person who confidently asserts that UNIX was never a deliverable and contributed to the development of the atomic bomb undoubtedly has fascinating stories to tell. Oh, to have had dinner with him...</p><p>This is the sort of paper I hope to revisit at different stages in my life, anticipating that different aspects will resonate depending on my mindset and the challenges I face at any given time.</p><p>As the saying goes, history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme, and this seminar demonstrates that truth. One notable change, though, which I appreciate, is the increasingly lenient dress codes we enjoy in the tech industry today. üëïü©≥‚úä</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper"
