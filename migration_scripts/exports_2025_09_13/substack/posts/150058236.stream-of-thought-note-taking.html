<p><em>tl;dr Stream-of-Thought Note Taking is an opinionated approach to brain-dumping thoughts on paper to aid the process of clarifying your own ideas.</em></p><h4>Table of Contents</h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/i/150058236/the-power-of-deletion">The Power of Deletion</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/i/150058236/tools-for-modeling-thoughts">Tools for Modeling Thoughts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/p/stream-of-thought-note-taking">Can you get to the point?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/i/150058236/stream-of-thought-note-taking">Stream-of-Thought Note Taking</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/i/150058236/extending-to-chain-of-thought-and-llms">Extending to Chain-of-Thought &amp; LLMs</a></p></li></ul><h2>The Power of Deletion</h2><p>One of my favourite Yuval Noah Harari <a href="https://youtu.be/Mde2q7GFCrw?si=kRmYnGX0otQX0Q35&amp;t=8345">quotes</a> from his interview with Lex Fridman is on the power of the <strong>delete button</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>I trust myself that I have, to some extent, the ability to press the delete button. The most important button on the keyboard is delete.</p></blockquote><p>In fact, the sentence youâ€™re reading right now is a result of having pressed the delete button more times than Iâ€™d like to admit.</p><p>Deletion is very powerful, and necessary, but it can hinder the process of writing and clarifying your own thoughts if introduced too early in the process.</p><p>I donâ€™t know much about sculpting, but can appreciate a good Greek sculpture when I see one, so will use that to draw an analogy:</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Before a sculpture is polished or textured, it needs to be blocked, modeled, and carved.<br>Writing is no different.</p></div><h2>Tools for Modeling Thoughts</h2><p>There is an abundance of tools and options for modeling our ideas, thoughts and words.</p><p>I donâ€™t recall where I first heard this quote but I remind myself of it as I work with different people under different circumstances:</p><blockquote><p>Introverts think to talk. Extroverts talk to think.</p></blockquote><p>Throughout the last couple of decades, you could talk to those around you, yourself, or even a rubber duck. You could write your ideas down on paper or a digital device. You could also speak into an audio recorder and play it back later.</p><p>Today, I find myself regularly using tools that werenâ€™t available just a few years ago. I go on walks talking to <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8400625-voice-mode-faq">OpenAIâ€™s advanced voice mode</a>. I use a <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable tablet</a><em> </em>as a replacement for paper. Iâ€™ve also, on a few occasions, brain-dumped 30+ minute monologues into a AI-enabled note taker so I can play it back, get a transcript and review the key takeaways without any extra work. I use <a href="https://fireflies.ai/">fireflies.ai</a>, but there are a handful of tools providing a similar service.</p><h2>Can you get to the point?</h2><p>If youâ€™ve made it this far, youâ€™re probably tired of the philosophical life lessons and want me to get to the point. Hopefully you enjoyed the long-winded introduction though :)</p><p>The process Iâ€™m about to describe is something Iâ€™ve been introducing more regularly in the following situations:</p><ol><li><p>The early stages of thinking through a problem</p></li><li><p>Learning a new subject, domain or tool</p></li><li><p>Aimlessly wondering around on a topic Iâ€™m unfamiliar with</p></li><li><p>Managing a mind full of overwhelming thoughts &amp; ideas that I need to organize</p></li><li><p>Reviewing something that Iâ€™ll need to organize and provie concise feedback on</p></li></ol><h2>Stream-of-Thought Note Taking</h2><p>Stream-of-Thought (SoT) note-taking aims to <em>model</em> ideas that can later be <em>crafted</em> and <em>polished</em>. The goal is just to get the raw ingredients on paper.</p><p>It biases towards fast, concise, deliberate written bullet points. It prevents run-on long-winded sentences, limits double-takes and does not allow deletion.</p><p>I decided to turn this into a game. Here are the rules:</p><p><strong>Enabled controls:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Everything must be a bullet point</p></li><li><p>Bullet points must be 100 characters or less</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Enter</strong></em>: Start a new thought or idea (i.e. a bullet point)</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Indent (push)</strong></em>: Provide additional details related to the previous idea</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Unindent (pop)</strong></em>: Start a new idea unrelated to the previous point</p></li></ol><p><strong>Disabled controls:</strong></p><ol><li><p><em><strong>Up</strong></em>: You cannot go back and edit a previous bullet point</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Backspace/delete:</strong> </em>You cannot edit or delete anything that was written down</p></li><li><p>Thinking a thought thatâ€™s not written down</p></li><li><p>Over-thinking before writing something down</p></li><li><p>Grammar or spell-check</p></li></ol><p>At first glance, this might seem like making a bullet point list. The difference lies in the mindset shift when you understand who the target audience is.</p><p><em><strong>ðŸ«µ You ðŸ«µ</strong></em></p><p>These bullet points arenâ€™t meant for anyone else. They donâ€™t need to be presented or grammatically correct. No one other than you will ever read them.</p><p>The goal is to exhaust everything you might be thinking until youâ€™ve achieved a clear mind. Once itâ€™s all on paper, you can move on. You could:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Organize it</strong>: Turn the rough ideas into real content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Summarize it</strong>: Get an LLM to summarize to organize it for you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leave it</strong>: Move on and let your brain do any of the necessary post-processing.</p></li></ol><p>The following is a simple and contrived example where I re-enacted some of the notes I put together before writing this blogpost. When I cover more complex topics (e.g. researching Auth0 and Envoy proxy last week), the final result looks different.</p><p>The beauty of this method is its broad applicability to anything you need to think through.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif" width="1000" height="938" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:938,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:301563,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05zZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6ac7467-db04-49a4-9e20-4e3ca29683b8_1000x938.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Extending to Chain-of-Thought &amp; LLMs</h2><p>I admit that the name for this method was inspired by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">Chain of Thought</a> methodology implemented in <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">OpenAIâ€™s o1</a> model.
