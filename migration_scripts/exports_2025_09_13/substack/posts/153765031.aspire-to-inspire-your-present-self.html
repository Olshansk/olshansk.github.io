<p>Earlier this week I asked myself: <em>“<strong>Why do I listen to so many podcasts?</strong>”</em></p><p>This led me down a mental rabbit hole of reflection while I sought an answer to: <em><strong>“What is the source of my intrinsic motivation?”</strong></em></p><p>I came to the conclusion that if I were to listen to a podcast (or read a blog) of myself five years in the future, I want to be inspired by it today. Today, at 32, I’m hoping my 27-year-old self would be inspired by this blog, just as I currently seek inspiration from him. <em><strong>It’s how I know I’m achieving my full potential at every step along the way.</strong></em></p><p>If you’re curious about how I got to this conclusion, read on. If not, feel free to stop here and I won’t hold it against you. :)</p><p>But first, I’m going to share some notes on how and why I listen to podcasts.</p><div><hr></div><ol><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/p/aspire-to-inspire-your-present-self">How I Listen to Podcasts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/p/aspire-to-inspire-your-present-self">Why I listen to Podcasts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/i/153765031/advice-to-your-younger-self">Advice to Your Younger Self</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/i/153765031/advice-to-your-future-self">Advice to Your Future Self</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://olshansky.substack.com/i/153765031/a-short-note-to-myself">A Short Note To Myself</a></p></li></ol><h1>How I Listen to Podcasts</h1><p>I’ve been using the <a href="https://www.snipd.com/">Snipd</a> app to listen to podcasts for a couple of years now.

I usually listen to podcasts at either 0.7x or 0.8x speed and find myself rewinding 5 minutes back very frequently. I compensate for this by taking advantage of various opportunities throughout the day to listen. Whether I’m on a walk, at the gym, driving somewhere or doing errands around the house, I’m extremely grateful for the abundance of insightful content and conversations that are so readily available.</p><p>It often feels like I’m a fly on the wall listening to the world’s most brilliant minds share ideas and thoughts. 🧠⚡️🧠          🪰</p><h1>Why I Listen to Podcasts</h1><p><em>Listening to podcasts is great, but why?</em></p><p>During one of my recent silent (podcast-free) walks, there was a thought floating around that wanted to reflect on why I’m listening to podcasts all the time.</p><p>I caught it, focused on it, and answered it for myself. As with most things, it’s never just one reason, but writing it down helps distill what the core reasons were.</p><h3><strong>1. It’s a source of knowledge</strong></h3><p>I might be listening to the latest episode of the <a href="https://share.snipd.com/show/7f8ada6c-8328-4b5a-9db3-03641efc98b3">All-In-Podcast</a> to stay up to date with what top of the economic food chain is looking at when it comes to economic, tech, politics or ur-anus.</p><p>Alternatively, I might be listening to <a href="https://share.snipd.com/show/a12218e8-63a0-4205-8900-906bb9e50394">The Theories of Everything</a>, where Curt is discussing <em><a href="https://share.snipd.com/episode/149d8d71-9779-42f0-b73a-d293b3e42ff4">A Radical New Vision of the Conscious Cosmos</a>,</em> merging ancient wisdom with modern science through the lens of philosophy.</p><p>It’s an opportunity to learn broadly and deeply every day, and I'm Lovin' It.</p><h3><strong>2. It’s a window into an individual</strong></h3><p>I’ve found that a long-form interview by a good prepared interviewer results in unparalleled insight.</p><p>not planned or choreographed in advance.</p><p>It’s more than just a long call or dinner with a close friend. These conversations are between two or few people whose experience, depth and insight far exceeds my own. The conversations are not planned or choreographed in advance, but a lot of preparation goes into them. There’s no pressure to “perform”, but there is a lot of inherent focus and energy because both parties know that a large audience will be listening.</p><p>These seem effortless when led by individuals like <a href="https://share.snipd.com/show/3dc564e5-e8f7-4f72-a598-79498f162e8b">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href="https://share.snipd.com/show/58c6e181-d2ff-4da6-a7ee-39414fb72dba">Tim Ferris</a>, or <a href="https://share.snipd.com/show/85d6570c-a7b2-4cec-9d57-bbd4b725e6aa">Lex Friedman</a>, but it’s only because they’re masters in their craft.</p><h3><strong>3. It’s direct uncensored access</strong></h3><p>There are no walls, no censors, no barriers and no limits.</p><p>The conversation is as transparent as the participants choose, and today’s platforms enable direct, global distribution.</p><p>For example, Dharmesh, the CTO of HubSpot, doesn’t even know I exist. Yet <a href="https://olshansky.notion.site/A-Billionaire-s-Guide-To-Going-From-4-hour-to-1-Billion-Net-Worth-Dharmesh-Shah-152676fd2df78182baa9fcad7aa719ac">this snippet</a> from a recent episode of <em><a href="https://www.mfmpod.com/">My First Million</a></em> showed me that we’re the same type of introvert:</p><blockquote><p>And this is why I don't do one-on-one meetings because it doesn't scale, right? This is one of the reasons I'm here and not elsewhere. It's not just because I like you guys, it's because I can have an impact. […] What's the best way for me to use this time so that if I look back on it, are the people that are spending an hour and a half-ish listening to this [thinking] “was that a good use of my time?” Did Dharmesh deliver on the promise of at least marginally increasing my probability of making my first or next million?<br><em>- Dharmesh Shah</em></p></blockquote><p><em>If you know, you know.</em></p><h3><strong>4. It’s easy and convenient</strong></h3><p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t call this out.</p><p>A smartphone, a pair of earbuds, an internet connection and an app is all you need to have access to this knowledge anytime and anywhere.</p><h3><strong>5. It’s a source of inspiration</strong></h3><p>Podcasts are one of the core sources of motivation, inspiration and idea generation for me today.</p><p>Aside from capturing snippets, I often find myself frantically reaching for my phone to write down a new idea or a reflection that was triggered by something I heard.</p><p>It’s analogous to reading, and <a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/5e92a9f6-aadc-4c89-8419-5661934b616e">this snippet from a recent 20VC</a> episode sums it up well:</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“If you want inspiration, read.<br>If you want clarity, write.”<br>- <a href="https://x.com/GuillaumeMbh">Guillaume Moubeche</a></p></div><h1>Advice to your younger self</h1><p>One of my favorite podcast questions looks harmless, but it’s not an easy one to answer: <em><strong>“What advice would you give to your younger self?”</strong></em></p><p>In particular, when the interviewee is in a more mature stage of their career and life — <em>you can define that for yourself</em> — the answers can be really eye opening. It spans from meta and philosophical to practical and tangible.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“So the advice was along the lines of chill out, don't stress so much, not so much anxiety. Everything will be fine and be more to yourself.”<br>- <a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/3cd775fa-47f7-48ae-8da3-59f1e9c0c815">Naval Ravikant</a></p></div><div class="pullquote"><p>“You sort of have to have some financial sure model of how you're going to pay for all of this. […] I actually like Disney's formulation of that, which is: We don't make movies to make money. We make money to make movies.”<br>- <a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/c3f7f20d-8c15-442a-b6f7-6e6ac5409488">Danny Hillis</a></p></div><h1>Advice to Your Future Self</h1><p><em>“Advice to your younger self” </em>is very abstract and contextual. Are we referring to my 10, 20, 30 year old self? Am I 50, 60, 70 or 80 when I’m providing this advice? There are too many permutations, and my perspective continues to change every single day.</p><p>Reflection is great, but I’m still at the stage where I spend most of my time thinking about the future rather than the past. Similarly to reflecting on how and why I listen to podcasts, I do the same in other areas of life before deciding on actionable takeaways.</p><p>Over the last few years, I’ve taken part in a few public X spaces, conference panels and public presentations. I started keeping a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoUslw_v__c&amp;list=PLeHvNSh0enXSflgNf-YC6jW6K3Fh4cS5E&amp;index=19">YouTube playlist</a> of some of them. Looking back at videos I created on the Android team in 2013 is fun, but what should I create today, tomorrow and a year from now?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif" width="446" height="250.25555555555556" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:404,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:446,&quot;bytes&quot;:82440,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/avif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fV0E!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa922295e-5ff5-46d2-a1cc-80a130ed7e37_720x404.avif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>With Inspiration being one of the biggest reasons of why I listen to podcasts, the framework is quite simple. If I were to do a podcast today, at 32, I hope my 27 year-old self would find it inspiring. Same goes for a podcast I would have done at 27 and listened to at 22. Looking in the other direction, I think of what a podcast would capture when I’m 37 if I were to listen to it today. Or, what a conversation with 42-year-old me would sound like when I listen to it at 37.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“Aspire to be inspired by your future self.”<br>- Daniel Olshansky</p></div><p>It also doesn’t have to be a podcast.

Then at 35, you create a podcast that inspires the 30-year-old you. It’s a simple but powerful idea: if you’re constantly doing things that your younger self would find exciting, you’re on the right path.</p><h3><strong>To 27-year-old Olshansky:</strong></h3><ol><li><p>Be intentional with how you consume podcasts.</p></li><li><p>Seek inspiration from your future self.</p></li><li><p>Apply the ideas you learn (through writing, projects, or speaking).</p></li></ol><h3><strong>To 37-year-old Olshansky:</strong></h3><p>I can’t wait to see what you’ll achieve.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Fun fact</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia">This piece from </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia">The Guardian</a></em> (2004) was the first (to my knowledge) recorded piece that suggested the term “Podcast”:</p><blockquote><p>With the benefit of hindsight, it all seems quite obvious.
