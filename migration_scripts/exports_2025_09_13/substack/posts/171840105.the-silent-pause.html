<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p><em>tl;dr The Silent Pause is inspired by The Silent Manifesto and is primarily targeted at slow-thinkers.</em></p><p>One of my favorite posts from the past decade is <strong>The Silent Manifesto</strong>.</p><p><strong>TODO</strong>: Add a link to the Silent Manifesto above.</p><p>It’s a methodology I apply on a regular basis, either in part or in full. Usually, it’s related to meetings at work. Occasionally, I apply its principles independently—when reflecting on something I’ve read or reviewing something I’ve written. It’s one of very few process-oriented blog posts I recommend to someone at least a couple of times a year.</p><p>In this post, I want to share <strong>The Silent Pause</strong>. It’s inspired by The Silent Manifesto, and in many ways, a mirror of how I think. As a byproduct, it’s also part of the culture that trickles down the engineering culture at Grove.</p><p>If you’re a fan of The Silent Manifesto, and consider yourself to be a slow thinker, I think you’ll appreciate this. It requires some comfort with discomfort, a minimal dose of situational awareness, a tad of authority, and a lot of frustration with unproductive meetings.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Silent Manifesto</strong></h2><p><em>tl;dr The Silent Manifesto is how most meetings should be run. It puts guardrails in place and acts as a forcing function to prevent people from falling into easier, more comfortable, and less output-oriented meetings.</em></p><p>On the off-chance you’re in the unique bucket of people who reads my blog but hasn’t heard of one of Jeff Bezos’ infamous meeting methodologies, here’s the quick version.</p><p>The Silent Manifesto makes writing, reading, and thinking part of the process before we start discussing. In particular:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Preparation</strong> – The organizer writes a 2–5 page document outlining: purpose, background/context, desirable outcomes, and key decisions/questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Silent Reading</strong> – Everyone spends the first 15–30 minutes reading in silence, making notes, and leaving comments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discussion</strong> – The second half of the meeting is a live discussion, resolving complex comments and making decisions on open questions.</p></li></ol><p><strong>TODO</strong>: Revisit the original Silent Manifesto and refine these bullets.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Meeting Loop of Doom</strong></h2><p>If you follow the Silent Manifesto and have an experienced leader, meetings usually turn out okay.</p><p>But when meetings go off track—spiraling, going in circles, and ending with “hard stop, let’s schedule a follow-up”—you’ve entered what I call the <strong>meeting loop of doom</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an example from work:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Meeting lead</strong>: “We should use either [tool #1] or [tool #2] for this part of the migration.”</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: “Do you know why the previous team used [tool #3] here?”</p><p><strong>Lead</strong>: “Not 100% sure, maybe because…”</p><p><strong>Attendee #1</strong>: “I think it was because…”</p><p><strong>Attendee #2</strong>: “Yes, but maybe also because…”</p><p><strong>Lead</strong>: “Interesting, maybe they were trying to…”</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: “All interesting, but do we have <em>any</em> concrete evidence why this decision was made? Any references?”</p><p><em>Everyone fills the air with inconclusive hypotheticals.</em></p></blockquote><p>Classic loop of doom.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Silent Pause – Team Meeting</strong></h2><p>Here’s what I did:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Me</strong>:</p><p>“Okay, here’s what we’re going to do.</p><p>Let’s all take a 5-minute break.</p><p>Then, in silence, we’ll spend 10 minutes researching for a link, reference, or evidence for why this tradeoff was made. Or use the time to understand the tool itself.</p><p>If we don’t find anything, we’ll just accept ‘it worked’ and move on.”</p></blockquote><p>Doing something like this comes with a few luxuries:</p><ul><li><p>We don’t schedule many meetings, so I knew people were available after the fact.</p></li><li><p>Leadership alone isn’t enough to reset a meeting—you need a bit of authority.</p></li><li><p>It’s rare. Used sparingly, it strengthens team culture. Overused, it kills it.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Silent Pause – Question on Priorities</strong></h2><p>One of my personal pitfalls is prioritization on the spot.</p><p>I like to gather notes, organize them, reflect, and go on a walk. The right answer usually hits me the next morning during my workout.</p><p>But often, I don’t have 24 hours—I have to make a decision <em>now</em>.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><p><em>Ongoing discussion around tasks, blockers, priorities.</em></p><p>Colleague: “Should we do X or Y first?”</p><p>Me: “Hmm… Give me 45–60 seconds.”</p><p><em>Silence in the room.</em></p><p>Me: (thinking through downstream dependencies, unknowns, customer needs…)</p><p>Me: “Let’s do X first, revisit Y next week.”</p></blockquote><p>That silent 60 seconds? It often feels awkward. But if it saves hours or days of wasted effort, it’s more than worth it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Take this with a grain of salt—I hate scheduled meetings and I work in a technical domain.</p><p>Adhoc meetings are great. Well-prepared meetings with clear agendas are great. Cutting meetings short is great.</p><p>But I’ve got scars from those “11:30 to 12:00” filler meetings. How do those even exist?</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>A Bit of Self-Reflection</strong></h2><p>They say your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness. For me, that’s slow thinking.</p><p>The Silent Pause is my antidote to that—my way of accounting for it instead of fighting it.</p><p>My current solutions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Improv</strong> – A fun hobby to practice thinking on the spot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Panels</strong> – I don’t love them, but they’re improv in a professional wrapper.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Silent Pause</strong> – A methodology (not a crutch) to accommodate slow thinking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Preparation</strong> – Outlines, notes, reviews. Always prepare.</p></li></ul><p>Culture trickles down, and leadership sets the tone. A healthy org creates space for both top-down and bottom-up ideas. The Silent Pause is one of mine.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Special Thanks</strong></h2><p>This post was inspired by @Wes’ writing. Many of the tools in my leadership toolbox come from her blog.
