<p>You may have heard or had personal first hand experience with Imposter's syndrome. But beyond that, some of us may also have an internal pessmisist.</p><p>Imposter's syndrome had reach "mainstream status" to a degree where we all laugh and joke about it in group settings saying: "Yea, me too."</p><p>In a similar fashion, I always assumed that we all have an internal pessimist as well, but it might not be as common. If this resonates with you, I hope the rest of this</p><p>---- Leaning Into The System ---</p><p>As an engineer who grew up following the system, external validation has always been a core part of my character development. Go to school and be the top of your class. Participate in extra curriculars activities and excel in any way possible. Parcitipate in sports and always aim to win. Go to a good university and receive a scholorship. Apply to top tier companies, pass the interviews and get a high paying job. When you're surrounded and can fallback on the system, you feel like you're doing the right thing and succeeding.</p><p>But if you're goal is to play a key role in doing trully great (link to article by PG), you have to look outside the bounding boxes of the system. You have to take on the real world, which is much uglier and more challenging.</p><p>---- The fine line between Confidence, Optimism and Ego ---</p><p>To be a leader in this world, it's not just about what you do or say, but also how you say it. You have to exude confidence, which comes in different forms. Elon stutters, takes long pauses and makes it clear that nothing will stop him from achieving his goals for humanity: interplantery species, autonomous vehicles, etc... Zuck. Chamath speaks with the ego of a fintech bro but the mind of an engineer, which is likely why he's not hated.

If your inner voice is what keeps you going, then it'll also be what's holding you back.</p><p>If intrinsic motivation is your driver in doing great work, then it'll also hold you back when you make a mistake.</p><p>There's a difference between the anger and frustration of perfectionaism, and the inner pessimist that picks &amp; pokes at any mistake you made.</p><p>I rememeber being in 9th grade, getting near perfect scores on most of my programming tests, but crying myself to sleep when I got a C on one of them. It was just a bad day. It wasn't about being perfect, it was the inner pessimistic challenging if you'll ever snap out of it.</p><p>--- Does everyone have one ---</p><p>If you've ever suffered any form of light or serious depression, you might be able to relate.</p><p>If you've gotten past it, you'll also know that there's only one way to get over it: You have to decide, for youself, that it's time to let it go. You know what the right thing to do or think is, but it's easier said than done.</p><p>The inner pessimist will never go away, but he (or she) can get smaller, quiter, distant until it fades into a memory. If you have an inner pessimist, you likely also have a very powerful driver.
