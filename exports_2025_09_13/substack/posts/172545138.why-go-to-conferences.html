<p>I'm gonna drop some ideas about my thoughts about conferences and presentations. So I'm I thought about why go to conferences. It's a waste of time, or is it not I think there's a talent in place. If you're head's down building and you know what the customer needs, you may or may not need to go. Our reason to go to a conference is to sell if you have a product and you're trying to increase awareness and distribution. Another reason to a conference is when you want to identify problems, if you're being explored to the stage, that's the reason to go to a conference. If you're new to an industry, that's the reason to go to a conference to build connections and meet people. But if you already know everyone, then there's no need. If you're a leader in the space, then you might want to go to accomplish the inspire and show people what you're doing and why you're doing it. If you're junior, it's a way for you to look for opportunities. If you're kind of in between things, and going to different conferences of different industries, there's a reason to go to events, and kind of just in the same way you change a pure environment, it is a change in environment. It can also be a form of entertainment, you know, to socialize and meet people and you never know what will happen. So kind of is it a waste of time or is it not? If you just go to conferences and it's the same people, the same time, probably no need. But you want to vary them. And there's a time and place to just be heads down, and there's time and place to go out. Same thing when it comes to presentations. Sometimes it's to show the world. There are keynotes, sometimes it's to teach and get feedback and ideas. Sometimes it's a forcing function for you to organize your ideas. There's a great quote that to gain clarity right to get inspiration read. So, to broaden your perspective, wash your presentation, to sharpen your perspective, do a presentation. And of course, we can also talk about stage fright and your ability to explain yourself, think on your feet and things like that. All of those are. variations of the same thing and kind of what we're targeting. So let's use all of these notes and turn it into a tube in a blockb post.</p>
