# Image Migration Analysis - January 14, 2025

## Purpose

This directory contains comprehensive analysis of missing images from blog posts during the migration from Medium and Substack exports to the Hugo static site.

## Background

During a review of the site, we discovered that many posts were missing their original images despite the text content being successfully migrated. This analysis was conducted to:

1. **Identify the scope** of missing images across all posts
2. **Prioritize** which posts needed image restoration first
3. **Track progress** during the image restoration process

## Key Findings

- **45 posts** contained images in the original exports
- **30 posts** were missing ALL their images on the site (66.7%)
- **1 post** had partial images (2.2%)
- **9 posts** already had complete images (20.0%)
- **Success rate**: Only 22.2% of posts with images had been properly migrated

## Priority Posts Fixed

**High Priority (Most Images):**
1. ‚úÖ GATE: Gateway Abstraction Technical Elements - 21 images restored
2. ‚úÖ 7 Pocket Network Analogies - 12 images restored
3. üîÑ An Incentive to Label - 8 images (in progress)
4. ‚è≥ Data Science for Software Engineers - 7 images (pending)
5. ‚è≥ 5P;1R Jellyfish Merkle Tree - 6 images (pending)
