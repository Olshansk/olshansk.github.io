    The other book that most helped me was Sun Tzu's Art of War, the ancient military manual written by a Chinese general. I learned three invaluable lessons from Sun Tzu. First, he writes, the good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. I was too exposed politically.

**Short-Term Pacts**

If the White House loses foreign policy to the State Department, you will never get anything done. After we arrived

**Bibi and Great Expectations**

- Jared Kushner recounts when Bibi Netanyahu stayed at his house and read 'Great Expectations'.
- Netanyahu wanted to take the book, but it had a sentimental inscription from Kushner's girlfriend.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Jared Kushner**
    
    I had met the Israeli Prime Minister many years earlier when he spent a weekend with my family on one of his trips to the United States. At the time, he was a private citizen and was speaking around the world. My father, who met Bibi through his support of pro-Israel causes, invited him to stay at our home in New Jersey while he was in town. B.B. Stayed in my bedroom, so I was relegated to the basement, where I slept with his security guards on pull-out couches. Jet-lagged, B.B. Couldn't sleep, so he pulled a book off my shelf. Great Expectations, the classic novel by Charles Dickens, and got halfway through it. The next morning he asked if he could take the book to finish it on the road. Ordinarily I would have been happy to give my book to the Israeli leader, but this book was a gift. I flipped to the front page and showed him the inscription. It was from my girlfriend at the time. B.B. Smiled and graciously left it behind. When we met in the Prime Minister's office on June 21, B.B. Expressed his thanks for the President's recent visit. He was grateful that I had worked to defend Israel at the United Nations during the transition, and was relieved that the United States was once again supporting the Jewish state after Eight years of strained relations under the Obama administration. When I brought up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Bibi thought we should delay working on the issue. He had survived as Prime Minister for eleven years by appealing to his conservative base and opposing a Palestinian state. This is not the right time, he said. He went on to explain that he didn't want Israelis to think that he was using peace negotiations to distract from an ongoing government investigation. This is a high priority for President Trump, I said, and if we're going to work with you on Israel's many requests, we need Israel to work with us on this. Bibi reluctantly agreed. 
    
    As we drove from Jerusalem to Ramallah, Greenblatt reminded me, don't say that we're for a two-state solution because it means different things to different people. It was good advice. And I decided to avoid the term until we had defined what it meant to be a state.

**MBZ's Observation**

- MBZ observed that Jared Kushner was different because he asked questions and tried to understand their perspectives.
- MBZ believed they would make peace in the region.

    **Jared Kushner**
    
    Before we departed, MBZ made one more comment. The United States typically sent three types of people to conduct diplomacy, he said. The first were people who fell asleep in meetings. The second were people who read talking points with no ability to converse. The third were people who came and tried to convince them to do things that were not in their interests. He observed that I was different. I was the first person to come asking questions and really trying to understand their perspectives. He believed we would make peace in the region. I was honored by MBZ's observation, and I never forgot

**Kelly Shoves Ivanka**

- John Kelly shoved Ivanka in the hallway after a contentious meeting, revealing his true character.
- He later apologized, which Ivanka accepted, marking the only time Kelly visited their West Wing office.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Jared Kushner**
    
    Ivanka was walking down the main hallway in the West Wing when she passed him. Unaware of his heated state of mind, she said, Hello, Chief. Kelly shoved her out of the way and stormed by. She wasn't hurt and didn't make a big deal about the altercation, but in his rage, Kelly had shown his true character. An hour later, he came to the second floor and paid a visit to Ivanka's office to offer a meek apology, which she accepted. Ivanka's chief of staff, Julie Radford, had been meeting with Ivanka and heard the apology. It was the first and only time that Ivanka's staff saw Kelly visit their second-floor corner of the West Wing. When Trump hired Kelly, he asked him to be the West Wing's four-star general, and Kelly took that request way too literally. Trump was an unorthodox president who thrived on hearing from multiple viewpoints when making decisions. After Kelly came in, Trump joked that his office became so quiet and empty that he missed the action. Kelly cared more about controlling the process than producing results. Trump cared way more about results than process. Assistant to the president, Chris Liddell, had

**Ivanka's Diplomacy**

- Ivanka Kushner skillfully negotiated with Senators Susan Collins and Bob Corker, who were initially at odds with President Trump.
- Her efforts were crucial for passing tax reform, which included provisions to double the child tax credit.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Jared Kushner**
    
    Through many visits to their offices, dinner conversations at our house, and long phone calls, Ivanka became their most trusted confidant at the White House. And because of her skillful diplomacy and delicate negotiation, she got them both to a yes. Without Ivanka, tax reform probably would not have passed, and it certainly would not have included provisions to double the child tax credit and establish a new incentive for employers To offer paid leave to working parents. These were two of the most successful aspects of the tax reform legislation, and they have given more than 40 million American families an average of more than $2,000 in tax savings Each year. As I navigated through all the forces that tried to take me down, I managed to maintain the confidence of the President. There were times, however, when I could feel that even his faith in me was dwindling. Soon after my interview with the Mueller investigators, I was alone with the President in his cabin aboard Air Force One. He asked me how Ivanka and I were holding up. I told him we were weathering things okay, all things considered. I want you to know, I wouldn't hold it against you guys if you wanted to return to New York, he said. Washington has turned out to be a vicious place, and you guys had great lives before this, and they are still waiting for you if you want them. I wasn't sure if this was his way of suggesting that I should leave, and I didn't want to ask. With as much confidence as I could muster, I told

**Don't Cower Under Pressure**

- In the short run, moving the embassy will be more difficult for peace, but in the long run, it will be easier. Show leaders that you aren't constrained by convention.
- The Middle East respects those who do what they say and don't cower under pressure.

    Trump turned to me and asked if moving the embassy would make it harder to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians. In the short run, it will be more difficult, I said, but in the long run, it will be easier because we will build capital with Israel, while showing world leaders that you aren't constrained By convention. The Middle East is a rough neighborhood where leaders respect those who do what they say and don't cower under pressure. Concerned about the peace plan, Trump then asked if we should wait six more months and see if the plan gained traction. While that should be considered, this is a relatively quiet period in a normally volatile Middle East, I said. Anything can happen, and in six months, you might not have the same hand to play. After hearing the opposing view from Tillerson and weighing the potential risks and benefits,

**Confronting Tillerson's Misunderstanding**

    She did, and I said to the Crown Prince, Secretary Tillerson told me that you implied that we are coordinating daily. I can't have this. He is the Secretary of State, and while I work on the Middle East file, I report to him on foreign policy, and we try hard to stay in sync on everything. With Tillerson standing there listening to our conversation, MBS replied that Tillerson must have misunderstood. MBS's brother, Khalid, who at that time was the Saudi ambassador to the United States, had followed Tillerson's suggestion and had met in the White House that very day with the whole NSC Middle East team and staff from the State Department. MBS questioned whether Tillerson was perhaps unaware that his State Department team had been meeting with Khalid and his team regularly. As Tillerson listened, his face turned bright red. I hung up the phone and told him to get a better grip on his team's activities before accusing me of things I had not done. Tillerson lashed back. He said the Saudis were the biggest funders of terrorism and predicted that MBS would never make the reforms he promised. I'm selling Saudi short, he added, using a stock market term to indicate that he was betting against them. Then he threw his hands in the air and screamed, I can't operate like this. I feel like we have four secretaries of state. Usually, I avoid engaging in futile arguments, but this was enough. I could feel my voice rise. If you actually did your job and implemented what the president asked, we would have only one. My words had stung. The former oil titan was growing more frazzled

Look, I know this was a misunderstanding, I said. You are the Secretary of State, and I want to work with you. If you give me any suggestions on how I can change my style or process to make you comfortable, let me know, and I will do it. He stared at me for a few seconds, offered no suggestions, and stormed out.

**Kelly's Power Play**

- Kelly excluded Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt from a Situation Room meeting about the Jerusalem Embassy for 'their own protection'.
- However, he told Friedman he didn't want history to show that three Orthodox Jews influenced such a consequential decision.

    **Jared Kushner**
    
    Despite the fact that I was the White House lead on Middle East policy, Kelly refused to let Jason Greenblatt or me join. This was for our own protection, he assured me. He explained that he was concerned that the decision would result in violent attacks on our embassies, and if Americans died as a result, he didn't want me to be blamed for it. Later, I learned that he had given Friedman an entirely different reason. He didn't want history to show that three Orthodox Jews, who might be biased in favor of Israel, had participated in such a consequential meeting. This was another of Kelly's power plays. By design, Friedman was outnumbered in the meeting, but he was more than prepared to respond to those who opposed the move.

    Next, the president turned to Mattis, who explained that he couldn't understand why so much focus had been placed on the Jerusalem issue. He had been to Israel on countless occasions, and each time he went, his meetings were in Tel Aviv. Why move the embassy to Jerusalem if Israel's Defense Department is in Tel Aviv? The group turned to Friedman for a response. Where is the Pentagon? He asked Mattis, who replied that it was in Arlington, Virginia. Then Friedman

**Tillerson's UN Resolution Strategy**

- Rex Tillerson suggested acknowledging the Palestinian claim to East Jerusalem to prevent them from leaving negotiations for a generation.
- Jared Kushner refused, arguing that giving concessions in response to threats sets a bad precedent.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Jared Kushner**
    
    He approached me at a White House holiday reception and explained that the situation was dire. We should acknowledge the Palestinian claim to East Jerusalem to give them a bone and allow them to save face, he said. Otherwise, they will walk away from the table and not come back for a generation. If they don't come back, they don't come back, I said. If you respond to their threat by offering a concession, that sets a terrible precedent. For decades, our diplomats have accepted a dynamic where the Palestinians say jump, and U.S. Diplomats ask how high. Tillerson rolled his eyes. He wasn't convinced, but I didn't belabor the issue.
