    He recalled that Obama kicked off their meeting with a backhanded compliment. I've been watching your speeches for the past years, and I must say that you are an amazing politician. On so many issues, I still can't figure out where you stand. Are you for guns? Are you against guns? Are you pro-life? Are you pro-choice? You have this amazing ability to be on every side of an issue. Obama warned

**Chris Christie Transition Role**

- Jared Kushner confronted Chris Christie about his handling of his father's case, accusing him of being overzealous and causing pain to his family.
- Despite past grievances, Jared offered to support Christie in his transition role to help the country.

    **Jared Kushner**
    
    Between Chris and me, if we're going to work together, I should express that I felt the way you handled my father's case was overzealous, and it brought serious hurt to me and my family. Christy explained that he had just been doing his job, that my dad had committed a crime, and that it wasn't personal. Well, respectfully, I have a different point of view on that, I said. If it wasn't personal for you, then how come you challenged my father's release date after he had served his sentence? I hope you can understand how brutal it is for a family to have a loved one in prison. The only solace is having a date when your nightmare will end. When the prosecutor comes back and challenges the release date, and it gets delayed indefinitely, that's devastating to a family. So don't tell me it wasn't personal, because if it wasn't personal, you would have let him come home on time. You know the crime your father committed was terrible, Christy started to say. Then Trump interjected. Chris, it was a family dispute. Look, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter, I said. Donald wants you to do a job. You have my word. I've put that in the past. And I'll do everything I can to support you in that effort. I'm here to help. This is about an opportunity to help the country. This is about service, and we can take the personal situation that has happened and put it aside, because that's not relevant right now to what we're doing.

**Bannon's Panic**

- Steve Bannon called Jared Kushner in a panic, saying that Christy was trying to get on the plane to convince Donald Trump to make him chief of staff.
- Bannon thought that Christie was angling to slot his political cronies into the most important appointments.

    Called me in a panic. Christy is trying to get on the plane, Bannon said. We've got to keep him off. He wants to talk Donald into letting him be chief of staff. We can't let that happen. The transition effort is a train wreck. He's angling to slot his closest political cronies, including anti-Trump establishment types, into the most important appointments, regardless of their qualifications. Both Bannon and Stephen Mnuchin reviewed Christie's transition materials and believed they failed to meet proper vetting, research, and professional standards for hiring key Personnel. They told Trump and me that Christie was unprepared for the task. Plus, Bannon added, Chris is politically radioactive. He has an 18% approval rating and is enmeshed in the Bridgegate scandal. Trump shouldn't have to carry his baggage. Trump didn't want his incoming administration, tainted by the legal mess in New Jersey. I want a nice, clean Mike Pence administration, not a corrupt New Jersey administration, he told us. In fairness to Christie, during the summer months, Trump had made clear that he did not want to focus on the transition before the election. At one point, when I told Trump that I had attended a three-hour transition meeting and assured him that Christie and I were working well together, my father-in gave clear instructions. Don't spend another minute on the transition. Romney spent all this time on the transition with his binders of women, and he lost the election. Spend all your time on the campaign, and if we win, we will figure it out. So, Christie

**Kissinger's Advice**

- Henry Kissinger advised Kushner that Trump's election made foreign leaders reassess their relationships with the U.S.
- Kissinger advised him to be careful about who he interacts with, as these relationships are valuable.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Jared Kushner**
    
    Months earlier, I had met Henry Kissinger, the historic former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. The advice he had given me then rang even truer now. Trump is talking about a lot of critical issues that have been ignored, which is making foreign leaders nervous. Don't reassure them. Right now, they're all doing reassessments. They are taking inventory of their relationship with America and determining what they have that they don't want to lose and what they are willing to give up to keep it. That puts the United States in a better negotiating position if you win. He further warned me to, be careful who you interact with in every country. A relationship with you is valuable currency in a capital city. Select carefully whom you want to give that power to. In one of Trump's many congratulatory calls with foreign leaders, he spoke with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Abe told Trump that he would love to meet. Honored, Trump invited him to visit Trump Tower. Soon after, I received a call from Obama's chief of staff, Dennis McDonough, who explained that typically, a president-elect declines meetings with foreign leaders out of deference To the current commander-in One president at a time, he told me. I relayed the message to Trump. Forget protocols, he said. It's not a big deal. It's just a meeting. If the leader of Japan wants to travel halfway across the world to see me, I am happy to meet with him. Trump also took a call

    Hess Corporation Chief Executive John Hess and Blackstone Group founder Steve Schwartzman asked me to meet with several high-ranking Saudi officials who were eager to strengthen Their relationship with the United States after the disaster in the Middle East with the previous administration. When Flynn, Bannon, and I met in New York with a small Saudi delegation, led by Dr. Fahad bin Abdullah Tounsi, they explained that they had a fraught dynamic with Obama over his positions on a number of challenges in the region, including Syria, ISIS, Iran, and Yemen, And were anxious to begin a new and hopefully more productive relationship with our administration. Bannon and I were tough. We told the Saudis that they needed to stop funding terror, improve their record on women's rights, pay for their own military, and begin taking steps toward working with Israel. We weren't interested in building the relationship if they weren't committed to making real progress on these goals. Fahad assured

    Years later, in January of 2021, the press wrongly reported that we would not allow the Secret Service to use a bathroom in our home. This was one of many false reports. When I offered to set up a way for the agents to access our home and use the restroom, the leader of our detail declined.

    I clearly had missed the memo on the dress code, and Saturday Night Live and Jimmy Fallon were not going to let me forget it. Even Ivanka still pokes fun at me for this one. When we met with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, he asked to see me one-on The Prime Minister took seriously Trump's public statements that he wanted countries to pay a larger Share of the defense cost. Al-Abadi said that he was willing to pay something for U.S. Protection, but essentially hoped for the cheapest deal. We probably could have gotten 20% of Iraq's oil revenues in exchange for our military support. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis thought Trump was crazy for suggesting such a proposition and stalled the discussion indefinitely. In another instance, Mattis and his leadership team came to talk to the president about their budget and claimed that $603 billion, the largest request since 2012, wasn't enough to Keep the country safe. They needed $609 billion to achieve military readiness. So with 1% more, you are military ready, but with 1% less, you're not? Trump queried, skeptically. After the brass had filed out, Trump pulled me aside and

    I wouldn't do that, she said. When I asked why, she responded, we're going through your tens of thousands of emails, and I found one email that you're going to want to see. I know it's painful now, but my job is for you to get to the other end in good shape. I'm thorough. I'm expensive. But there's a reason people use me. And you don't want to put out any statement until I've reviewed all the facts. Well, what does the email say? I inquired. I'd rather show it to you in person.

    Tell me about Ty Cobb, I began. He's a great lawyer. Do you trust him? Yeah, I trust him. It feels like there are so many people surrounding the president who don't have his best interests in mind, I continued. They are causing more problems than they are solving. Look, our lives would have been so much easier if we had stayed in New York, but we decided to come to Washington to help the president succeed. We didn't come here to fight with people and play political games. We care about him, and we care about our country. Dowd, a former Marine and retired litigator who believed in Trump and saw this chance to work for the President as his final tour of duty, probed me with questions. I answered each one honestly and took him through the facts of my Russia case. After about ten minutes, he looked at me and said, You know, from the moment I got here, McGann, Priebus, and Bannon each came up to me individually and said that you and Ivanka were the Problem and that everything would be resolved if I was able to get you out. But I think I get it now. You're the only ones who actually care about the president. I see what these self-serving bastards are trying to do. I'm on to them. I've got you back. And I'm going to get every single one of them. I was later told that McGann, Priebus, and Bannon had drafted my resignation letter and were pushing the president to get me to sign it.
