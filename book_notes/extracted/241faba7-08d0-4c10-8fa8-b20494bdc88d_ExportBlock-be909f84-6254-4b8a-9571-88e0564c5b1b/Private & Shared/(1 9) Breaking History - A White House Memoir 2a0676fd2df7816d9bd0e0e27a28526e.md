**Moving to Washington**

    **Jared Kushner**
    
    After the 2016 election, Ivanka and I left behind our lives in New York and moved to Washington with our three young children. We knew we would face challenges, but we had no idea of the intensity of the storm that awaited us. It was probably better that we didn't. Nothing could have prepared us for the ferociousness of Washington. The attacks, the investigations, the false and salacious media reports, and perhaps worst of all, the backstabbing within the West Wing itself. On several occasions, I wondered if Ivanka and I had made the wrong decision

    **Jared Kushner**
    
    During my four years in the White House, I learned countless lessons that changed my perspective about how the government and the world really works. Three stand out. The first is that it's easy to make promises, but it's hard to achieve results. Trump came into office without an army of

**Achieving Solutions**

- Define the optimal solution and then work backwards to reach the best possible outcome.
- Bring everyone to the table to agree on shared goals and search for win-win solutions.

    **Jared Kushner**
    
    Second, I learned that our political differences are not always as insurmountable as we think. Ordinarily, the Washington game revolves around the party out of power trying to stop the party in power from accomplishing its priorities. While initially, I found this frustrating, learned to keep moving ahead and to focus on the long game. Almost all of the greatest accomplishments of the administration involved former adversaries coming together to make the lives of normal people better. Rather than starting from two different sides of the table on any given issue, from criminal justice reform to peace deals in the Middle East, I tried to bring everyone to the same side Of the table to agree on shared goals and search for win-win solutions. I wasn't always successful, but it is the responsibility of those in power to try. We can't solve problems by talking only to those who agree with us. For anyone who's looking to advance bipartisanship, I hope this book provides insight into how it's possible and why it often fails.

- Choose to help instead of dwelling on anger about things you can't control.
- Jared Kushner realized that anger wouldn't be productive.

    **Speaker 1**
    
    As I laid in bed staring at the popcorn ceiling of my apartment, I realized that my anger wasn't going to lead to anything productive. I was at a critical crossroads and had to make a choice. I could choose to be angry about things I could not control, or I could choose to help. I knew the answer immediately. I had to help my father,

**Ray Kushner's Holocaust Survival**

- Jared Kushner's grandmother, Ray Kushner, survived the Holocaust after the Germans invaded Poland in 1939.
- She witnessed the Nazis systematically exterminate Jews, including her mother and sister, and was forced to clean up the blood of murdered intellectuals while Germans danced.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Speaker 1**
    
    They taught me one of the most important things that I've ever learned. Life is a gift that can be taken from us in an instant. My grandmother, Ray Kushner, was 16 when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. Her family of six lived in Novogrudik, a quiet town located in eastern Poland, now part of Belarus. In 1941, the Germans seized control of the area and relocated about 30,000 Jewish people to a ghetto. Over the next two years, the Nazis systematically exterminated the occupants of the ghetto, including Ray's mother and sister. In one round of killings, the Germans brought the remaining educated Jews, about 150 doctors, lawyers, professors, and teachers, down to the town square. While an orchestra played and my grandmother and the other occupants of the ghetto looked on, the Germans shot them in the head, one by one.

**Ray and Joseph's Escape**

- Ray, her father, and her younger sister escaped the Holocaust by fleeing into the woods and finding refuge with the partisans.
- After the war, Ray and Joseph fled to Hungary, married, trekked through the Austrian Alps, and snuck into an Italian displaced persons camp.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Speaker 1**
    
    Ray, her father, and her younger sister were among the survivors. They fled deep into the woods and found refuge with the partisans, a group of freedom fighters who created hidden camps deep in the forest and carried out daring acts of resistance against The Nazis. Among the partisans, Ray reconnected with the young man from a neighboring town, Joseph Berkowitz, the youngest of eight children born into an impoverished Taylor's family. When the war came to an end, Ray and Joseph fled to Hungary, where they quickly married. The day after their wedding, they trekked through the Austrian Alps and snuck across the border into an Italian displaced persons camp. They applied to come to America using my grandmother's last name, Kushner, since my grandfather had accrued a rap sheet from smuggling cigarettes into the camp to provide for his family. As my grandmother recalled years later, we would go anywhere where we could live in freedom, but nobody wanted us. They waited three and

**Running Advice**

- Jared Kushner remembers his father's advice during marathon training: don't look up when there's a big hill, just focus on the next step.
- This advice helped him to keep his head down and achieve his goals.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Speaker 1**
    
    During my senior year of high school, I woke up at 4.30 each morning to train with my dad for the New York City Marathon. I will never forget what he told me as we ran up the big hill at the north end of Central Park. Running is like life. When there's a big hill at the end, don't look up. Keep your head down and watch your feet. Don't think about the top of the hill. Just think about your next step. Before you know it, you will achieve your goal and be at the top of the hill. In 1999, I was thrilled to learn that I had been accepted into Harvard. Like most students on campus, I was initially nervous about how I would perform against the world's top students. But I quickly learned that while many kids had high IQs, some didn't work hard or have common sense. I met my best friend while I was in the laundry room switching loads.

**Rookie Mistake**

- Jared Kushner recounts a mistake when purchasing an apartment building.
- He didn't verify the number of units, which were illegally constructed, reducing revenue.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Speaker 1**
    
    I made plenty of mistakes. On one purchase, an historic apartment building at 82 Monroe Street, I took the seller at face value when he quoted the number of units in the building. But after I purchased it, I discovered that many of the apartment units were illegally constructed. The lower number of rentable units dramatically reduced the projected revenue and eliminated much of the return that I had told investors we would make. After looking at several scenarios, I concluded that to salvage the project, I had to convert the building into condominium units, a far more involved and extensive construction Project than I was anticipating. It took us longer, but we ultimately made a nice profit. The experience taught me the importance of conducting due diligence on every detail of a business deal, even those typically taken for granted. Growing up so close to my dad's business, I had been immersed in real estate, but I learned that nothing could replace the experience of being responsible for an entire project, where I had to answer to investors, manage contractors, and keep tenants happy. I graduated from Harvard with honors, while making millions of

**Change of Heart**

- Jared Kushner initially wanted to be a prosecutor, inspired by the public policy focus of law school.
- His father's arrest and the prosecutor's actions against his family caused him to reconsider this path.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Speaker 1**
    
    After my father's arrest, however, as I watched a prosecutor inflict havoc and hardship on our family, I began to have second thoughts. I didn't think I could do that to others. My father ultimately decided not to fight his case in court. He recognized that he had let his emotions get the better of him and felt that he had sinned before God and was ready to take responsibility for his actions. He knew that fighting the charges would be a painful five-year ordeal for our family and diminish morale at his company. He pleaded guilty and was willing to accept the consequences, which the judge decided would be two years in federal prison. In April 2005, during my second year of graduate school, I traveled with my parents to the federal prison in Montgomery, Alabama.

    Silver and I ended up becoming close friends. I tried for three years to get them to sell the lease. Silver drove a hard bargain. Eventually, Stern made a good deal to give it up. We later sold the space to Inditex, the parent company of Zara, for $324 million, a record price per square foot. Navigating the fallout of 666 was the biggest challenge and learning experience of my business career. Being thrust into complex, high-stakes negotiations at a young age gave me unique training. I forged relationships with many of the titans in the industry, which proved invaluable moving forward. I did not win every negotiation, but I gained credibility by being honest about our difficult situation, offering constructive solutions, and seeking successful outcomes for all Parties. My goal was to increase the size of the pie rather than eliminate slices from it.

**Witnesses Headquarters Purchase**

- Jared Kushner bought the Jehovah's Witnesses headquarters in Brooklyn by offering $375 million without an auction.
- The Witnesses honored their word despite a higher offer, and the property's value significantly increased after renovations.

- **📚 Transcript**
    
    **Speaker 1**
    
    One of the best deals I made was purchasing the Jehovah's Witnesses headquarters in Brooklyn. When I heard that they were selling, I called their representative, Dan Rice, and asked him to let me participate in their auction. Located on the river next to the Brooklyn Bridge, the properties were unbelievable. They were the best-run buildings I had ever toured. They were so clean you could eat off the floors. I went to the representative's office that day and asked how much he wanted. He quoted $325 to $350 million. I told him I'd pay $375 million if he promised not to have an auction. He called his board, got approval, and shook my hand. The next day, a competitor offered him a higher number, but he said, Nope. We're Jehovah's Witnesses. We honor our word. He sold the property to me, and after renovations and rebranding, it is now worth close to a billion dollars. With every new purchase, I focused not on the last dollar, but on the next deal. I saw the potential in buildings that most people overlooked, and learned how to make that vision into

**Trump's Political Intuition**

- Trump understood the impact of globalist trade and immigration policies on citizens' jobs and safety, something other politicians ignored.
- This understanding, coupled with his media strategy, shifted public discourse.

    **Speaker 1**
    
    On Fifth Avenue, Trump understood intuitively what other politicians had long ignored. Citizens across the country were feeling the effects of globalist trade and immigration policies that jeopardized their jobs, safety, and very way of life. They were angry. This first of many media crises taught me what I later called the three rules of Trump. Number one, controversy elevates message. Number two, when you're right, you fight. And number three, never apologize. Most politicians follow polls,

Each day, the team that achieved the best return on investment received additional money to buy a larger share of ads the following day. The teams tested everything, down to whether the Donate Here button should be green or red, or whether an ad performed better with an eagle, an American flag, or a picture of Trump. This highly competitive environment produced staggering results. Under Pascal and Kobe's leadership, the advertising teams tested more than 100,000 ad combinations each day, gathering real-time public opinion data that preceded polling by several Days, and informed the campaign about which messages resonated most with voters. We quickly saw that ads did better when they were focused on Trump's pro-America policies, like building the wall, rather than on attacking other candidates. In total,
