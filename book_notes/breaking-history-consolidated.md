We knew we would face challenges, but we had no idea of the intensity of the storm that awaited us. It was probably better that we didn't. Nothing could have prepared us for the ferociousness of Washington. The attacks, the investigations, the false and salacious media reports, and perhaps worst of all, the backstabbing within the West Wing itself. On several occasions, I wondered if Ivanka and I had made the wrong decision"

> "Second, I learned that our political differences are not always as insurmountable as we think. Ordinarily, the Washington game revolves around the party out of power trying to stop the party in power from accomplishing its priorities. While initially, I found this frustrating, learned to keep moving ahead and to focus on the long game. Almost all of the greatest accomplishments of the administration involved former adversaries coming together to make the lives of normal people better. Rather than starting from two different sides of the table on any given issue, from criminal justice reform to peace deals in the Middle East, I tried to bring everyone to the same side Of the table to agree on shared goals and search for win-win solutions. I wasn't always successful, but it is the responsibility of those in power to try. We can't solve problems by talking only to those who agree with us. For anyone who's looking to advance bipartisanship, I hope this book provides insight into how it's possible and why it often fails."

My grandmother, Ray Kushner, was 16 when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. Her family of six lived in Novogrudik, a quiet town located in eastern Poland, now part of Belarus. In 1941, the Germans seized control of the area and relocated about 30,000 Jewish people to a ghetto. Over the next two years, the Nazis systematically exterminated the occupants of the ghetto, including Ray's mother and sister. In one round of killings, the Germans brought the remaining educated Jews, about 150 doctors, lawyers, professors, and teachers, down to the town square. While an orchestra played and my grandmother and the other occupants of the ghetto looked on, the Germans shot them in the head, one by one."

When the war came to an end, Ray and Joseph fled to Hungary, where they quickly married. The day after their wedding, they trekked through the Austrian Alps and snuck across the border into an Italian displaced persons camp.

Keep your head down and watch your feet. Don't think about the top of the hill. Just think about your next step. Before you know it, you will achieve your goal and be at the top of the hill. In 1999, I was thrilled to learn that I had been accepted into Harvard. Like most students on campus, I was initially nervous about how I would perform against the world's top students.

Key points:

- Jared Kushner recounts a mistake when purchasing an apartment building.
- He didn't verify the number of units, which were illegally constructed, reducing revenue.

> "I made plenty of mistakes. On one purchase, an historic apartment building at 82 Monroe Street, I took the seller at face value when he quoted the number of units in the building. But after I purchased it, I discovered that many of the apartment units were illegally constructed. The lower number of rentable units dramatically reduced the projected revenue and eliminated much of the return that I had told investors we would make. After looking at several scenarios, I concluded that to salvage the project, I had to convert the building into condominium units, a far more involved and extensive construction Project than I was anticipating. It took us longer, but we ultimately made a nice profit. The experience taught me the importance of conducting due diligence on every detail of a business deal, even those typically taken for granted. Growing up so close to my dad's business, I had been immersed in real estate, but I learned that nothing could replace the experience of being responsible for an entire project, where I had to answer to investors, manage contractors, and keep tenants happy.

- His father's arrest and the prosecutor's actions against his family caused him to reconsider this path.

Source text:

> "Speaker 1"

> "After my father's arrest, however, as I watched a prosecutor inflict havoc and hardship on our family, I began to have second thoughts. I didn't think I could do that to others. My father ultimately decided not to fight his case in court. He recognized that he had let his emotions get the better of him and felt that he had sinned before God and was ready to take responsibility for his actions. He knew that fighting the charges would be a painful five-year ordeal for our family and diminish morale at his company. He pleaded guilty and was willing to accept the consequences, which the judge decided would be two years in federal prison. In April 2005, during my second year of graduate school, I traveled with my parents to the federal prison in Montgomery, Alabama."

Navigating the fallout of 666 was the biggest challenge and learning experience of my business career. Being thrust into complex, high-stakes negotiations at a young age gave me unique training. I forged relationships with many of the titans in the industry, which proved invaluable moving forward. I did not win every negotiation, but I gained credibility by being honest about our difficult situation, offering constructive solutions, and seeking successful outcomes for all Parties. My goal was to increase the size of the pie rather than eliminate slices from it."

When I heard that they were selling, I called their representative, Dan Rice, and asked him to let me participate in their auction. Located on the river next to the Brooklyn Bridge, the properties were unbelievable. They were the best-run buildings I had ever toured. They were so clean you could eat off the floors. I went to the representative's office that day and asked how much he wanted. He quoted $325 to $350 million. I told him I'd pay $375 million if he promised not to have an auction. He called his board, got approval, and shook my hand. The next day, a competitor offered him a higher number, but he said, Nope. We're Jehovah's Witnesses. We honor our word. He sold the property to me, and after renovations and rebranding, it is now worth close to a billion dollars. With every new purchase, I focused not on the last dollar, but on the next deal.

The teams tested everything, down to whether the Donate Here button should be green or red, or whether an ad performed better with an eagle, an American flag, or a picture of Trump. This highly competitive environment produced staggering results. Under Pascal and Kobe's leadership, the advertising teams tested more than 100,000 ad combinations each day, gathering real-time public opinion data that preceded polling by several Days, and informed the campaign about which messages resonated most with voters. We quickly saw that ads did better when they were focused on Trump's pro-America policies, like building the wall, rather than on attacking other candidates. In total,"

If it wasn't personal for you, then how come you challenged my father's release date after he had served his sentence? I hope you can understand how brutal it is for a family to have a loved one in prison. The only solace is having a date when your nightmare will end. When the prosecutor comes back and challenges the release date, and it gets delayed indefinitely, that's devastating to a family. So don't tell me it wasn't personal, because if it wasn't personal, you would have let him come home on time. You know the crime your father committed was terrible, Christy started to say. Then Trump interjected. Chris, it was a family dispute. Look, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter, I said. Donald wants you to do a job. You have my word. I've put that in the past. And I'll do everything I can to support you in that effort. I'm here to help. This is about an opportunity to help the country. This is about service, and we can take the personal situation that has happened and put it aside, because that's not relevant right now to what we're doing."

The transition effort is a train wreck. He's angling to slot his closest political cronies, including anti-Trump establishment types, into the most important appointments, regardless of their qualifications. Both Bannon and Stephen Mnuchin reviewed Christie's transition materials and believed they failed to meet proper vetting, research, and professional standards for hiring key Personnel. They told Trump and me that Christie was unprepared for the task. Plus, Bannon added, Chris is politically radioactive. He has an 18% approval rating and is enmeshed in the Bridgegate scandal. Trump shouldn't have to carry his baggage. Trump didn't want his incoming administration, tainted by the legal mess in New Jersey. I want a nice, clean Mike Pence administration, not a corrupt New Jersey administration, he told us. In fairness to Christie, during the summer months, Trump had made clear that he did not want to focus on the transition before the election. At one point, when I told Trump that I had attended a three-hour transition meeting and assured him that Christie and I were working well together, my father-in gave clear instructions.

The advice he had given me then rang even truer now. Trump is talking about a lot of critical issues that have been ignored, which is making foreign leaders nervous. Don't reassure them. Right now, they're all doing reassessments. They are taking inventory of their relationship with America and determining what they have that they don't want to lose and what they are willing to give up to keep it. That puts the United States in a better negotiating position if you win. He further warned me to, be careful who you interact with in every country. A relationship with you is valuable currency in a capital city. Select carefully whom you want to give that power to. In one of Trump's many congratulatory calls with foreign leaders, he spoke with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Abe told Trump that he would love to meet. Honored, Trump invited him to visit Trump Tower.

Great Expectations, the classic novel by Charles Dickens, and got halfway through it. The next morning he asked if he could take the book to finish it on the road. Ordinarily I would have been happy to give my book to the Israeli leader, but this book was a gift. I flipped to the front page and showed him the inscription. It was from my girlfriend at the time. B.B. Smiled and graciously left it behind. When we met in the Prime Minister's office on June 21, B.B. Expressed his thanks for the President's recent visit. He was grateful that I had worked to defend Israel at the United Nations during the transition, and was relieved that the United States was once again supporting the Jewish state after Eight years of strained relations under the Obama administration. When I brought up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Bibi thought we should delay working on the issue. He had survived as Prime Minister for eleven years by appealing to his conservative base and opposing a Palestinian state. This is not the right time, he said. He went on to explain that he didn't want Israelis to think that he was using peace negotiations to distract from an ongoing government investigation.

At a dinner in Japan, he told Ivanka, On your worst days, wear your best suit. Walk with your head held high, show no weakness, and project that nothing has changed. In the wake of the clearance downgrade, I followed Abe's advice and decided to work even harder. Since I was no longer pulled into classified meetings, I had hours of additional time. I started to realize that I could get more done by not being involved in every decision. When the President asked me about bits of intel I hadn't seen, I tried to steer him to his national security advisor, H.R. McMaster. To borrow a concept from philosopher Isaiah Berlin's popular essay, The Hedgehog and the Fox, I became less of a fox who knew many things relatively well and more of a hedgehog who knew A few things very well.
