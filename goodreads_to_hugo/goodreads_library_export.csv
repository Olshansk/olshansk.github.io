102146148,What's Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies,Tim Urban,"Urban, Tim",,"=""""","=""""",4,4.31,,Kindle Edition,746,2023,2023,2023/06/04,2023/05/20,,,read,"Wait But Why - Tim Urban<br/><br/>This book captures precisely what I've been thinking, feeling and discussing in private for many years. It presents my political and other views, often seen as condescending and inappropriate. For some people, like myself, this book might help organize and validate one's view of the world, but I also believe that many others would be offended by the overall message delivered. Throughout the book, I felt seen and validated but also uncomfortable, confused and questioned my beliefs. <br/><br/>Note: The summary below is just a rough stream of consciousness, with little editing or proofreading, I captured after finishing the book.<br/><br/> ~~~ Personal Discomfort & Guilt ~~~ <br/><br/>I sometimes felt guilty listening to this book because it felt like an echo chamber of my thoughts and private journals. It introduced new pieces of evidence that I had not seen before and went into much more depth than anything I've journaled myself, but it did not present any new ideas I haven't had before. I generally avoid listening or reading things like this because there is little value to having someone else reaffirm what you already know, but I finished it per the recommendation of a close friend.<br/><br/>Growing up in Canada during my formative years, a good friend from a visible minority always reminded me that I would never understand what he and his family had to endure. This settled deep in my conscious and is a never-ending struggle I battle with. In fact, he made me read ""Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race,"" and reading that book was just as discomforting as listening to this one. There's a lot to unpack there, but before I continue, I think it's important to mention that I've experienced racism as a Russian immigrant in a Jewish kindergarten in Israel and then as a Jewish child in an Arab community, notwithstanding the multiple bouts of depression I've gone through as an adult with ADHD & OCD. In addition, the issues brought up in this book are one of the reasons I wasn't comfortable living in the Bay Area - I felt that I couldn't speak openly about my cultural & geo-political opinions.<br/><br/> ~~~ High Rung Thinking ~~~ <br/><br/>Though it was not a quality I had prior to finishing college, I've become very comfortable saying ""I don't know"" over the last decade and have tried to surround myself with similar people. I've also increasingly surrounded myself with deep, open-minded, high-conviction, but low-opinion thinkers who are always interested in learning more and evaluating both sides of an argument. This heavily relates to Tim Urban's point of thinking like a scientist VS an attorney VS a sports fan. I'm not a sports fan and have never been attached to a sports team because I've always viewed it as just a collection of people, so what difference does the team make? Is it just the geo-location that pays the bills? I've also never understood law because how can someone be ""paid to be forced to prove a specific point of view,"" even if it may not represent the actual facts? What Tim Urban refers to as ""low-rung politics"" is a concept I never understood and is something I associate with people I've decided to remove from my life. I do my best to follow a ""high-rung"" thought process in everything I attempt or strive for in life, though I am aware there is still a ton of room for improvement. High-run politics always felt like the obvious thing to do, and listening to this idea being validated made me uncomfortable because what does that mean I think of other people? My instinct wants to say that there are a ton of incompetent, ignorant people who are unwilling to put the effort to think, but that makes me reflect on myself as an asshole.<br/><br/>~~~ Political Labels ~~~ <br/><br/>Up until the age of 18, I could never understand why I had to label myself as a ""liberal,"" ""concentrative,"" ""democratic,"" ""republican,"" or somewhere on that spectrum. I was always able to compartmentalize which of my approaches or thoughts are seen as liberal and conservative in society. Still, I was perplexed about how that would transfer to myself being one or the other in all circumstances. The world changes, the people in each party change, and so do I through my life experiences. It never made sense, but I had to accept that that's what society is, and this book comforted me that I'm likely not the only one in this situation. I'm comfortable saying that I am pro ""high-run conservatism"" but would never be comfortable associating myself with the label of a ""Republican."" A label is a uniform, not a mindset, and there's no reason for us to commit to wearing the same uniform all the time.<br/><br/>~~~ Racism & Activism ~~~ <br/><br/>Tim makes the case that society sees the lack of activism in favour of racism as an act of racism, and per our society, those that are not visual minorities would never understand. Again, I agree with Tim's viewpoints on this, but I'm conflicted because all the time I spent living in the Bay area, I was surrounded by contradicting ideals. It's unlikely that anyone will ever read this sentence, but I do believe I can relate to how it feels. I have experienced other forms of racism, a light degree of poverty, multiple immigrations and multiple bouts of mental issues.<br/><br/>~~~ SJF ~~~ <br/><br/>I don't have much to add on the SJF (Social Justice Fundamentalism), aka Liberal Progressivism, points he mentioned, but they align and relate to everything that was said. It's unfortunate that universities have become SJF labs instead of idea labs, and that so many intellectuals have their hands tied behind their backs.<br/><br/>~~~ (Karl) Popper's Paradox ~~~<br/><br/>The Paradox of Tolerance."" It goes like this: If everyone is tolerant of every idea, then intolerant ideas will emerge. Tolerant people will tolerate this intolerance, and the intolerant people will not tolerate the tolerant people.""<br/><br/>I recently started listening to a podcast about Karl Popper's work and I absolutely loved this quote. <br/><br/>~~~ Quotes & Concepts ~~~<br/><br/>The following are just general quotes & concepts I wanted to capture while listening to the audiobook:<br/>- ""Technology makes for better good times and worse bad times.""<br/>- ""Scientists are not afraid to say I don't know.""<br/>- ""Research idea labs, not echo chambers.""<br/>- ""Primitive minds aggregate when there's concentrated tribalism.""<br/>- ""Wise people create good times; good times create foolish people; foolish people create bad times.""<br/>- ""Awareness but silence (without courage) changes nothing.""<br/>- ""In order to be truly anti-racist, you also have to truly be anti-capitalist.""<br/>- Some schools have stopped referring to the fundamentals laws of classical physics as ""Neuton's laws of motion"".<br/>- Fair doesn't mean we don't all stand on the same wooden box (i.e. similar opportunity), but it's the fact that some of us have wooden fences (i.e. hurdles) in front of us.<br/>- Asking for examples of racism is a form of racism in itself.<br/>- The Google gender manifesto may have had some valid points behind it, and a healthy high-run environment would have been more accepting of discussing it in public.<br/>- Arguing against BLM or SJF is like arguing against religion during the dark ages.<br/>- SJF silence is often seen as violence<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

Collins,"Collins, James C.",,"=""0062933809""","=""9780062933805""",4,4.24,Harper Business,ebook,46,2019,,,2022/11/19,,,read,"A 2-hour listen that made me realize I don’t need to read or listen to “Good to Great.”<br/><br/>This monograph by Jim Collins is worth listening to because it’s not a big-time investment and will let you know if “Good to great” is worth your time - for me, it wasn’t. The monograph is full of interesting examples, but it feels a bit outdated and very few people are in the position of leading companies that are doing “Good” and having trouble how to make them “Great.”<br/><br/>The tl;dr is that the flywheel is inevitable and you have to go with the flow. The next step in the evolution of any company has to be so obvious that it’s inevitable.<br/><br/>Jim talks a lot about what leads to success and outlines different methodologies to get there that I won’t reiterate here. It includes sketching out the flywheel, using the “hedgehog” concepts, but at the end of the day it boils down to: passion, hard work, identifying what you’re best at and determining if that fuels the economic engine.<br/><br/>Some other topics that really resonated with me is how vision with grit is irrelevant. Ultimately this boils down to needing to have a team full of disciplined people, and disciplined people don’t need hierarchy, they need direction and lack of distractions.<br/><br/>Some other ideas/concepts that stood out to me:<br/><br/>- Achieving success without understanding why is worse than failure<br/>- Ask yourself what you would do if you were an outside CEO coming in with a whipped out memory<br/>- Always reevaluate your success and understand why they worked. We have post-mortems but not post-successes.<br/>- Make a company go from good to great is one thing, but make it build to last is a whole different story.<br/>- If you’re organization disappears, would people miss it? That’s how you know you’ve succeeded.<br/>- Nothing listed above matters if you’re not at least a little bit lucky.",,,1,0

Parts of the book were inspirational, while others felt very “echo chambery” if you spent some time in the Bay-Area. Parts of the book felt like an action movie, while others felt like a monotone teacher giving a history lesson. Overall, if you’re interested in the history, with some specific anecdotes, of how Venture Capital came to be, I’d recommend this book. If your goal is to understand what’s happening in the world today, podcasts similar to “All-In” do a much better job.<br/><br/>— The notes below were raw & unedited —<br/><br/>Coopetition - By far, my favorite concept from the book was the idea of coopeition: competition & cooperation. The whole concept where “an engineer could ask a colleague from another startup for advice on a problem; no culture of secrecy inhibited cooperation” is exactly why Silicon Valley lost its luster, and why I believe the crypto industry will prosper. The fact that “a small number of tight relationships makes for less idea sharing and innovation than a large number of loose relationships” is exactly the transparent, digital world we live in and why I’m so excited to be working from home, while having the privilege of traveling to conferences in this day and age.<br/><br/>Fairchild Semiconductors - This company, founded in 1957, was basically the birth of Silicon Valley. The original founders, fairchildren, were literally writing the book that is so evident to startups today. Realizing that building a business is more than just about building, but about management. Knowing that raising money is even an option, wasn’t obvious back then. It’s crazy how these individuals were literally trying to figure things out on the fly when no playbook existed. The investment history and the number of hands it waved through was too many for me to remember.<br/><br/>Ycombinator - Paul Graham never set out to build out combinator but it kind of happened by accident and he went with the flow. In its early days, him and the other partners worked with the founders very closely, but recently it’s just become a pipeline of companies and lost its charm (in my opinion).<br/><br/>John Doerr - This is a name that I believe most people vaguely recognize, but the young generation (young Millennials or Gen Z’s)  like myself, won’t necessarily know what to attribute his work. Kleiner Perkins, chair by John, which is just a name I’ve heard of but no nothing about was once the Sequoia of today, having been early investors in Netscape, Cisco, Amazon, Google and several others. It was the gold standard but eventually fell behind. John Doerr supposedly bought 13% of Amazon for $8MM!!! He was also the one who introduced Eric Schmidt to Sergei and Larry. John has also been investing in Climate startups for over 15 years, but it’s fair to say he was at least a decade too early. He’s had his run, and is still around advising, so it was cool to learn about him. One other thing John and I also have in common is that “The number of different things about which John Doerr has said, this is the greatest thing ever, is a big number,” a rival investor noted about him and my friends say about me.<br/><br/>Jaycal & Uber - If you’ve ever listened to a podcast with Jason Calacanis, there’s a “small chance” he may have mentioned his super early investment in Uber. I knew he was an early investor, but I had never known how involved he was in the day-to-day operations, and all the drama that went until Dara took over. I think it gave me more respect for his work there other than having just been a source of money bags.<br/><br/>The PayPal Mafia - The history and politics behind how this came to be is fascinating. It wasn’t just a group of friends starting a big company and then splitting to do their own thing. Between Musk almost being ousted by the company, the negotiations between Musk & Thiel, Thiel convincing Max Levchin to apply his cryptographic work to payments, Nosek being an old friend of Max, it wasn’t just smooth sailing. Lots of pain, lots of negotiation, lots of headwinds, but it worked out!<br/><br/>Sequoia - Though this is a well known house name today, it was founded in 1972 and literally took decades to figure out its playbook before its hockey stick investments started succeeding.<br/><br/>What it means to be a VC? - To many, a VC is just someone who gives money, and there is definitely a time and a place for it. However, for those who really want to make being a VC part of their career, it’s all about taking that midnight call when the founder needs your advice, and flying out the next morning to get shit done.<br/><br/>Google - I learnt that Google innovated the VC industry in a few different ways. Firstly, prior to Google, investors got to own a VERY large part of the company (e.g. sometimes a majority). Google was one of the first companies where Series A only sold about 10% of the company to investors. Furthermore, it was the first company to give the founders “super shares” so they can maintain their decision making powers. Even though I believe this was done in good faith by Sergei and Larry because they had a ton of awesome ideas (electric cars, space elevator, smart fabric, etc…<br/><br/>Cisco - The founders of Cisco were Stanford students who pioneered the idea of LAN and then took it a step further with Cisco. However, these were not professional serial entrepreneurs. They were very eccentric personalities, without ambitions, but just following what they were interested in at the time, and didn’t hold control of the company for long. It’s fascinating how no one heard of what the founders have been up to or what they’re doing today. Lots of controversy here that I won’t get into.<br/><br/>Yahoo - TIL that Yahoo is actually an acronym and not just a fun thing to say. It stands for “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle”, which makes me feel like there’s a place for it in the crypto space ‘:). I also learnt that it was a simple site maintained by grad students before they really decided to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Softbank - I never knew how important of a role Masayoshi Son played outside of just investing billions in WeWork, I say only half-jokingly :). Apparently he’s been around for a while, and his approach to giving TOO much money has always been the case. He practically forced Yahoo to take his money by saying that he would offer it someone else if they don’t. When something like this happens, you don’t really have an option.<br/><br/>Metcalfe's law - Metcalfe’s is often used to value social networks (e.g. Facebook, Bitcoin) by stating that it hard to lose value once it exceeds a certain threshold. What I didn’t is that the person who coined it also invented the Ethernet!<br/><br/>Alibaba - Apparently Alibaba was a very unsexy investment & opportunity in its early days, and the person (whose name escapes me) who worked for Goldman and convinced them to invested, managed to get half of Alibaba for $5MM! However, the investment was so risky and unusual for the company, they sold out very early on.<br/><br/>Yuri Milner - Yuri Milner is one of my favorite investors, and part of it is probably because he’s Russian, so I do have a bias here. However, he’s an extremely successful investor, that does innovate in various ways, and manages to keep a very low profile relative to other billionaires. From this book, I learnt that he managed to increase his position in Facebook by buying out employees (before the IPO) at a lower price than the investment, which led him to a higher return, and helped Mark Zuckerberg concentrate his power.<br/><br/>UUNet - Apparently this was the first ISP provider in the US that no one knows about.<br/><br/>Tips & Tricks - If you’re a technical founder not trusted by an investor, let them invest the money and bring in the manager they want (assuming you trust the investor). This way you do less work, less management, make it an easier sell and make the investors happy.",,,1,0

Knowing the chapter names and using it as a reference is worth it.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The only thing that bothers me a bit, which was raised to me by a friend, is that Tony does have a vested financial interest in a lot of the companies and products he touted. He discloses all of his investments but sometimes says, ""This product is unlike any other, and that is why I decided to invest."" There was a product (whose name now escapes me) related to using ultrasound to help with pain. Upon searching for a clinic that supports this, I learned it's extremely proprietary technology only available in one clinic in the US.

25066990,Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet,Jesse Itzler,"Itzler, Jesse",,"=""1455534676""","=""9781455534678""",5,4.29,Center Street,Hardcover,272,2015,2015,2022/04/01,2022/03/26,,,read,"""""""<br/>While Goggin's book made me realize that there is no limit to what one can do, Itzler's book forced me to take immediate action, get off my ass, and understand that it's only me standing in my way of achieving what I want to want-to-do.<br/>""""""<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>There was no better follow-up to David Goggins' ""Can't Hurt Me"" than this book. If you listened to the audio version of Goggins' book (which I recommend more than the book given its format) and loved it, this is an absolute must listen right afterwards. Provided that the second audiobook is only 5 hours long, there is no excuse not to do so.<br/><br/>I stand by the order I specified above, even though this book was published three years priors to ""Can't Hurt Me."" At the time, Goggins kept a lower profile and is referred to as ""Seal"" throughout. However, knowing Goggin's backstory, I completed some of Itzler's stories and sentences before he provided details which was a fun game to play. For example, I knew they were going to meet up in San Diego, and I knew he would injure himself doing the 100-mile run. The craziest thing is that Goggins' didn't mention Jesse Itzler even once throughout his audiobook.<br/><br/>While Goggin's book made me realize that there is no limit to what one can do, Itzler's book forced me to take immediate action, get off my ass, and understand that it's only me standing in my way of achieving what I want to want-to-do.<br/><br/>A few examples of this from the past week include:<br/>I ran into the cold lake by my house and took a quick plunge even though I didn't want to. This is nothing compared to diving into a frozen lake in NYC.<br/>I finished my 10-minute row on a day when my back, legs and shoulders were sore. This is nothing compared to the 10-mile run, and hundreds of pushups Itzler had to do.<br/>I did 100 burpees at the gym at the same time as Jesse simply because I didn't want to. 10 minutes and 20 seconds bitch.<br/>I finished my self-imposed deadline at work last week when I suggested to my CTO that we finish it early next week, but he responded, ""why not now?""<br/>I am forcing myself to write this very book review when instead, I just want to brush my teeth, watch TV and go to bed.<br/>I took that cold shower in the middle of the day, which was worth it, even though I didn't want to.<br/><br/>This book also made me realize that I don't need a fancy gym and can continue training (in an intelligent way), even when travelling. Burpees, pushups, pullups, jump squats, running, and biking can get you into the shape of your life without any equipment necessary.<br/><br/>There are too many memorable anecdotes from the book to list out without reiterating everything, but the few that stood out to me were:<br/>Jumping into the cold lake and also freezing to death. Seal yelling ""abort mission"" was entertaining.<br/>Seal called the house renovation company and forced them to give Jesse a 40% discount after initially over-charging him because they knew he was a high-net-worth individual.<br/>Seal making a sweat puddle on top of Sarah Blakely's family carpet while working out in his room.<br/><br/>I plan to write a much longer article discussing the idea of callusing the mind, dopamine addiction, cold showers, ADHD, and these two books, which I believe are all interconnected, so I'll leave it here for now.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>One takeaway from the book that I believe is likely overlooked by many readers is how supportive Sarah Blakely was of Jesse Itzler at every step along the way. This is what you call true love, a true family and true support without being neither too dependent nor too controlling. Here's to the Iztler Blakely Family ",,,1,0

It is very bloated, repetitive, and has a bad mix of providing uninteresting details and a poor holistic perspective. The reason I gave this book 2 stars rather than 1 is because I could see myself potentially coming back to it in the future when I am at a different point in my life.<br/><br/>As a Capistlit and a Jew, I was intrigued by the title and wanted to see what the book had to offer. I was looking to learn something new and perhaps change my perspective.<br/><br/>However, the book delves into random uninteresting details. For example, the author spent several pages discussing the types of words Karl Marx used to describe Jews and how that affected the public's perception of them. I did not find it to be a very interesting perspective because there are many people who use a multitude of words to describe various groups of people, so this was just a very specific example of one person saying a few things about a very specific group of people. All races, religions, and groups experience the same problems. <br/><br/>Some historical reasons for why Jews historically managed money is because lending money was considered a sin in Catholicism. This is interesting but was delivered via a very mundane and uninteresting manner in the book.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that reading the wiki page on Economic Antisemithism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_antisemitism) is a better use of time than reading this book.<br/>",,,1,0

Unfortunately, it did not…<br/><br/>A friend of mine recommended it after saying that it changed her perspective to life, and how it impacted the decisions she makes on a day-to-day basis by analyzing her dreams. While there is some merit to the fact that dreams can be used to analyze one’s subconscious, I believe the idea is overdone and unnecessary for those who have a high degree of self-awareness.<br/><br/>The idea of dream interoperation was probably novel in 1899, when the book first came out, but the concept that dreams are a partial representation of an individual’s unconscious mind is has become such a major part of social mode and pop culture, that it’s nothing new. Prior to this book, some religious organizations or tribes might have seen dreams as messages from religious deities, but this was the first “scientific” approach to dream analysis. I used the term “scientific” very loosely, because it is a collection of anecdotal cases rather than large scale studies.<br/><br/>There were a few interesting points made throughout the first third of the book, but I didn’t find it interesting enough to stick with it.<br/><br/>=== Cool notes/facts I took away from the book === <br/><br/>History<br/>- People used to think that dreams were a way of supernatural beings trying to communicate with us<br/>- Dream analysis dates back to Aristotle, who wrote to pieces of work on the human psyche related to dreams<br/>- There was an interesting quote that said “Nature is demonic, not divine”<br/><br/>Physical sense while sleeping<br/>- Dreams are affected by both physiological and psychological factors <br/>- Physiological effects are exhilarated while one is sleeping<br/>    - A sound, a light, a touch are over-intensified<br/>    - A drop of water makes you think you drowned<br/>    - Slight heating of the body while the person is sleeping results in burning during dream <br/>- There was a case where something fell on someone’s neck while sleeping, which resulted in decapitation in the dream<br/>    - The most interesting point here is the time dilation.

I’m extremely glad that this is the one I picked up. I never cared or thought too much of the Nike brand, but my appreciation for it has ten folded. This book covers an unexpected founding story, gives a glimpse into what it was like to do a startup before Venture Capital was commonplace, and documents several fascinating interpersonal and work relationships.<br/><br/><br/>~~ Favorite quotes/lessons from the book ~~<br/>1. Concentrate on doing only one small task at a time. It clears the mind and is more conducive to good work.<br/>2. Don’t tell people how to do things. Tell people what to do and let them surprise you.<br/><br/><br/> ~~ Phil Knight  ~~<br/>I didn’t know anything about Phil Knight prior to the book, but my takeaway is that he does things cautiously, but is still willing to take on risk and doesn’t overthink things too much.<br/><br/>As a 24 year old, he picked up his things, travelled the whole world, and pursued a crazy idea he got while doing his MBA at Stanford. When meeting with his Japanese business partners for the first time, he had the guts to say he owned a company called “Blue Ribbon” before anything ever existed.<br/><br/>He always prioritized and understood the importance of personal life even as he was growing his business. Finding a partner, and later balancing kids & work, was a struggle, but he managed to find a balance.<br/><br/>Though he hated selling, he still managed to be really good at it. When he wasn’t, he hired the right people to help him!  Everything about how he tackled and handled life challenges is extremely motivating and lines up perfectly for a great startup story.<br/><br/><br/> ~~ Blue Ribbon  ~~<br/>It’s impressive to think how big and well known Nike is these days given how long it took Blue Ribbon to gain traction in its early days. Founded  in 1964, it wasn’t until 1971 that they officially re-incorporated as Nike, and introduced the brand to the world at a Chicago retail sports conference in 1972.<br/><br/>It’s not very difficult for startups today to find funding and get off the ground. In fact, companies like SoftBank often say “We know you only asked for $10MM, but what can you do with $1B?”.  For Nike, while sales were good and doubling every year, they couldn’t take on any inventory risk because they were barely staying afloat paycheck to paycheck. Even though Silicon Valley started taking off in the 70s with the founding of Apple, no one was interested in Sports Apparel.<br/><br/><br/> ~~ Product Obsession  ~~<br/>One of the most important takeaways I got from the founding of Blue Ribbon is how important product obsession is with the founding team. Consider the following:<br/>- Phil Knight: Obsessed with following his ideas, taking action, and building a great company.<br/>- Bill Bowerman: Cofounder, Phil’s track coach and a “Shoe dog”. He was obsessed with experimenting different types of materials for new shoes, optimizing a person’s habits/diet, and anything else that will improve a runner’s results.<br/>- Jeff Johnson: Nike’s first employee who was obsessed with building a brand, creating popup stores, expanding, making sales and doing anything that’ll help the company thrive.<br/><br/>The first 10 employees at Nike/BlueRibbon were all obsessed with making shoes, expanding the brand, or building a great company. This is extremely important to the founding of a company.<br/><br/><br/> ~~ Cool facts about Nike  ~~<br/>- The logo was originally bought for only $35! Phil Knight made sure that designer was appropriately compensated at a later point in time though.<br/>- The name Nike (meaning Greek goddess of victory) came as an idea to an early employee in a dream. Phil made a last minute decision to go with Nike instead of Dimension6. I wonder if the company would’ve succeeded with the different name?<br/><br/><br/> ~~ Nike Today ~~<br/>I’ve never done in depth research of Nike but have overheard how they’re a sweatshop that takes advantage of workers in third world countries. What I didn’t know is that Nike did attempt to raise the minimum wage at different points in time, but this action was blocked by the foreign government. Specifically, they said that if a shoemaker ends up making more money than a doctor, it will lead to a loss in balance of power and wealth. Everyone would opt to being a shoemaker and no one would train to be a doctor…<br/><br/> ~~ Appreciation for Sports ~~<br/>I’m not a sports enthusiast myself, but there were two points in the book raised by Phil that made me gain some appreciation for it:<br/>1. When sports are at their best, the energy and spirit of the athlete merges with the audience. Like books, they give an option to live vicariously through other means.<br/>2. Since running laps has no finish line, one must find the willpower from within.<br/><br/><br/> ~~ Japan ~~<br/>Japanese customs and stories never seize to amaze me. I’ve read several books and watched various documentaries or movies based Japan and it’s fascinating how different their culture is from the rest of the first world.<br/><br/>Businessman are very patient and respectful, but can get very cut-through unexpectedly. The takeover and negotiations with Tiger kept me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>In one of the meetings Phil had with Tiger executives, everyone left the meeting abruptly without saying anything. Though the outcome was positive, I’d be dumfounded on how to interpret the situation.<br/><br/><br/> ~~ Random facts ~~<br/>- Khaki pants used to be called “Suntans” in the 60s.<br/>- Phil mentioned how his Stanford education in the 1950s only cost 100s of dollars. Even with inflation, this is ridiculous…<br/>",,,1,0

I really hope this shows that everyone can preserver regardless of the environment they grew up in. <br/><br/>At various points throughout the book, I had to remind myself that the events were taking place in Idaho and not some third world country. The patriarchal, religious, abusive family seems like such an outdated concept that I forgot it still happens in first world countries. Instances where this happened include:<br/>- Brothers abusing their sisters.<br/>- Husband forcing his wife to become a “mid-wife”.<br/>- Preferring traditional medicine rather than modern medicine when both are available.<br/>- Being anti-government and anti-hospital.<br/>- “Putting all the kids to work in the farm”.<br/><br/>Though I couldn’t relate to Tara on most fronts, I could related to her on lack of common knowledge as she entered her adulthood. Similar to how she did not know what the holocaust was in College, I did not know of Mormon’s until I had met one in my second year of college. The other person looked at me as if I was crazy, and I was really embarrassed. <br/><br/>Most importantly, I must admit that I’m very motivated and driven by Tara’s success. A lot of people the tech industry suffer from imposter’s syndrome, but the mental and inter-personal conflicts that she had to overcome were so much more than that. Having listened to a few of her interviews, she seems like a very intelligent, well-read, respected honest and kind person. I can’t even begin to imagine what it was like to grow up in a family with a bipolar mother, a threatening brother, and unsupportive mother. She somehow managed to overcome and unlearn everything that was enforced onto her throughout childhood.<br/><br/>There were a couple of interesting things I learnt from the book:<br/>1. Midwifing is illegal in the US, but apparently the only option for people without money or insurance. <br/>2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion. I simply find this fascinating because of how much it associates with my background (being a Russian Jew) and having never heard of it. It is a fabricated antiseptic text where Jews plan out global domination. I honestly think this could be a great foundation for the plot of a comedic film starring James Franco.<br/>",,,1,0

I read this book at a time when I was struggling to achieve a deep state of work and am extremely grateful to have come across it. The book provides various techniques to achieve deep work, allowing the reader to “build their own” solution based on their lifestyle and needs. Similar to “Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker, I would classify this as a must read.<br/><br/>Though I’ve been a lot more organized and cognizant of my time in recent years, I do not believe I’m as productive as I was when I was younger. There is a multitude of factors contributing to this, ranging from the need to always reply to messages or emails at work, the dopamine addiction to check my social media feed, the feeling of checking off tasks on my TODO list, etc… I was a much less experienced software engineer 10 years ago, but the lack of responsibilities, the lack of a smartphone, the lack of perfectionism, and the lack of a TODO list helped me concentrate on work in a much deeper fashion. It really saddens me to have lost that ability.<br/><br/>As an engineer at a large tech company, one of the things I find really frustrating is how shallow work is perceived as “being productive”.  The author mentions Marissa Mayer who once told her employees that if you’re not responding or are not available, then you’re not working. Going to meetings, responding to emails or replying to messages in a timely manner may seem and feel productive, but it rewires the reward function in our brain to favor easy shallow work over difficult deep work. Real impact and change with measurable outcomes can only come out of deep work, and unless you are a high level executive whose responsibility it is to be shallow on many different things, one would simply be lying to themselves by saying they’re productive.<br/><br/>Boredom is okay! I feel that most people, myself included, have grown accustomed to doing something (productive or not) with every passing minute of free time. This may involve replying to a message, checking social media, listening to a podcast or audibook, etc… However, as Newport mentions several times, complete mental downtime is actually conducive to concentration, generating original ideas, reducing stress, and letting the brain recharge for a future session of deep work. Paraphrasing one of his quotes: “Allowing the conscious mind to rest lets the unconscious mind make new ideas - downtime is important and diversified the thought purpose.”<br/><br/>Prior to reading this book, I was a big proponent of the “world hard play hard” idea, but skeptical of the “4-hour work week” concept. I now understand how much they go hand-in hand! I’ve grown accustomed to accept the fact that long hours and weekends are the only way to achieve good results. In reality, 3-4 hours of deep work is more than enough time to achieve good results, and it is difficult to sustain this effort more prolonged periods of time. It is the quality of how we spend our time, and not its quantity. With the exception of real immediate deadlines, 3-4 hour of deep work followed by 2-3 hours of shallow work a day should be more than enough for anyone to finish their job. This leaves a ton of time for hobbies, exercise, games, movies and other activities. The author reiterates this idea many times and highlights how important it is to truly shut down when you shut down, and to truly wire in the you’re working. This isn’t new advice, but Cal Newport did a a great job at conveying this message.<br/><br/>Carl Newport discusses the difference between execution and ideation. When I was young and naive, I used to think that I should keep all my startup ideas to myself in case someone “steals it”. However, I later realized that ideas are a dime a dozen and that execution (combined with some timing and luck) is 1000x more important than the idea itself. In order to execute though, one needs to achieve a state of deep work. This relates to another idea that is implicitly mentioned throughout the book, which is the difference in between aptitude, productivity and output. Newport references a study showing that students who study less actually have better results. He also mentions Joshu Foer, author of Moonwalking with Einstein, as well as a journalist who became the memory champion of the world. In addition to being passionate about memory training, and having an intellectual inclination to it, his ability to stay cognitively concentrated and non-distracted while preparing was his leading indicator to success.<br/><br/>Cal Newport provided many anecdotal examples of various successful individuals through the book. The following are just a few that stood out to me:<br/>- Neil Stephenson, a famous sci-fi author, has famously admitted to being a bad correspondent (https://www.nealstephenson.com/why-i-am-a-bad-correspondent.html) by being non-responsive to email.<br/>- Don Knuth, a renowned Compute Scientist, has famously stopped using email since the early 1990s (https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html).<br/>- J.K. Rowling, author of Harry Potter, forced herself to finish the last book by staying at a $1,000/hotel in London.<br/>- Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur and author, flew all the way to Tokyo and back just to grab an espresso in order to finish a draft for a book with a nearing deadline. https://fitproessentials.com/the-4000-round-trip-ticket-to-tokyo/<br/>- Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, is famous for being a young programming prodigy and a great businessman. However, one of this lesser known qualities is his ability to work intensively and concentrate on one task at time. In particular, he can read fast, retain a lot of that information, and is a big advocate of not multi-tasking.<br/>- Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist, avoided almost all administrative overhead as a professor just so he can concentrate on physics. His excuse is that he is simply not reliable or dependable.<br/>- Tim Ferris, a famous “self-improvement Guru” talks a lot about how important it is to have a sense of urgency and how it is easier to just let bad things happen and move on rather than fixate on them.<br/><br/>There were many concepts and ideas introduced throughout the book, but the following stood out to me personally:<br/>- Artificial deadlines: If there is no external force setting a deadline (presentation, conference, boss, family, etc…), you have to create artificial deadlines and disallow yourself from working outside specific time ranges (i.e. evenings, weekends, etc…).<br/>- Fixed time productivity: Created allocated “work slots” and do not allow yourself to continue working outside of that slow.<br/>- Consolidation: Consolidate related work into batches (day, weeks, etc…) to avoid the cost of context switching.<br/>- Rhythmic Philosophy: Build chains and reward models (e.g. similar to streaks on Snapchat) that’ll reward deep work.<br/>- Offline blocks: If your brain has been re-wired to seek distracting stimuli, you’ll most likely need to create dedicated offline blocks; both during and after work ours.<br/>- Key goals:  Do not start a deep work session without very specific well-defined goals and rules. In order to avoid getting distracted, the tasks should be very well defined ahead of time, and the rules of what’s allowed should be set; for example, whether using Google during that session is okay or not.<br/>- Looping: When you’re not making progress or looking for a distraction, one often starts looping: thinking and trying the same thing over and over even though they’re not getting distracted by other things. It is important to make a note of this and simply move on.<br/>- Attention residue: Multitasking is a myth.<br/>- 4DX: The 4 disciplines include: Focus, Leverage, Engagement and Accountability. A good comparison of OKR and 4DX can be found here: https://www.perdoo.com/resources/okr-vs-4dx<br/><br/>Since reading this book, the following actions have helped me see measurable results in my output:<br/>- Rather than feeling productive by starting my morning with cleaning my inbox, I try to be productive by completing a single difficult time consuming task.<br/>- I make a detailed list of tasks every morning and update it if/as plans change throughout the days. When I finish something, I look at my list and know exactly what to tackle next. It is very important that the tasks are extremely details with well defined outcomes. I also use this document to logs interesting ideas or concepts I came across throughout the day.<br/>- I installed a chrome extension that blocks distracting websites (news, twitter, Facebook, etc…) between 8am and 6pm. I’ve found myself opening those websites on numerous occasions, only to see the blocked page.<br/>- I block out email for the first half of every day so I’m not distracted by incoming messages. Leaving an inbox open, or glancing at it every once in a while can be a short but devastating distraction.<br/>- I block out a 4 hour DNS (Do Not Disturb) period on my work calendar every morning. This helps me avoid meetings from being scheduled over my DNS. I was originally worried other people may find it off-putting that I may not be available or responsive during certain hours, but everyone is very reasonable and understanding as long as you plan accordingly.<br/>- On Weekdays, I turn my phone off between 9am and 5pm.<br/><br/>Fun note: This book was written when Twitter was still running on Ruby on Rails, which really dated it.",,,1,0
242472,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"Taleb, Nassim Nicholas","David Chandler, Микола Климчук","=""""","=""""",2,3.95,Random House ,Hardcover,366,2007,2007,2020/07/01,2020/05/04,,,read,"https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/black-swan<br/><br/>Overall, I’m sorely disappointed by the first Nassim Taleb book I’ve read. The major points made by the book are insightful, but not very cohesive. Interesting examples and anecdotes are interspersed through the book, but most of it feels repetitive and mundane. The only reason I did not stop halfway through is due to the book’s pop culture status, and Taleb’s overall social clout. In retrospect, I believe that some sort of book summary service (i.e. Blinkst) would have served sufficiently well as a replacement for reading this whole book.<br/><br/>With that said, there are still a few interesting points I wanted to recollect….<br/><br/>One of the most profound quotes from the book was: “History and societies do not crawl. They make jumps. They go from fracture to fracture, with a few vibrations in between. Yet we (and historians) like to believe in the predictable, small incremental progression.” I completely agree and believe this couldn’t be closer to the truth, especially during COVID time; ironically he mentioned the impact pandemics could have. Most importantly, I love how much this quote relates to my personal and work life. Day-to-day changes accumulate, but only large jumps (a full weekend of work, a move, a job switch, etc…) make profound and long-lasting changes in my life. This relates to my single favorite piece of “life advice” he provided, which is that extreme short-term stress is much more effective that low long-term stress.<br/><br/>Nassim’s background somewhat reminded me of the first half of Ray Dalio’s Principles. He started as a quant right before the 1987 crash and did well financially. Amusingly, he would tell people he’s a limousine driver to avoid seeming rich, and would frequently tip taxi drivers $100 bills because “money became easy”. I related to his points of avoiding mainstream news or having any faith in the efficient market hypothesis. If anyone is reading this, do you remember how the market went down and then back up on the same pieces of news during the 2016 election?<br/><br/>The concepts of Mediocristan and Extremistan introduced in the book were interesting but reiterated WAY too many times… In Mediocristan, people don’t take risks, progress is not made, and everyone lives by the status quo. In contract, in Extremistan, people see things differently, take risks, make ambitious goals, and lead to change. Formalizing and stating these terms is nice, but they’re quite intuitive and do not need to be re-explained from a hundred different perspectives.<br/><br/>Taleb went into extensive discussion about how experts have a reckless prediction problem, and related it to how biased humans are at estimation. Not many key takeaways, but a few interesting points. Firstly, according to Taleb, almost all economics forecasts are wrong. For example, no one could predict the 6% to 1% change in interest rates in Tokyo in 2000. Another example includes how none of the large American banks were able to predict they would lose their entire investments in South & Central America in the summer of 1992. He also brought up a study of how students who were asked to estimate how long a project would take would were all wrong: optimistic students said 26 days, pessimistic ones said 47, but on average, it took 56 days.<br/><br/>I found his brief discussion of Benoit Mandelbrot very interesting. Mandelbrot was a key individual in linking randomness to geometry and responsible for defining the “seven states of randomness”, which is a fundamental concept of risk analysis, fractals and probability theory. While Mandelbrot was a physicist, he was also very drawn to economics. When asked why that is, he said that it is due to the abundance of data. Even though no one objects to making money, it made me realize why so many other mathematically inclined people (i.e. Ed Thorpe) tend towards the finance industry. It is not just the allure of making money, but also the large amounts of data you can use to build models, do analyses and make predictions.<br/><br/>Interesting concepts:<br/>- Anchoring: A form of cognitive bias where an initial piece of information heavily affects an individual’s future decision making. <br/>- Pascal’s wager: A philosophical argument which posits that humans bet with their lives whether god exists or not.<br/>- Packaging: The process of telling people “this is where your idea works well” instead of “this is where your idea doesn’t work”.<br/>- Kolmogorov theory of turbulence: The idea that a turbulent flow is composed of small eddies.<br/><br/>Interesting points:<br/>- All gamblers have beginner’s luck because they wouldn’t have become gamblers if they weren’t lucky initially.<br/>- Seneca, a well known stoic, was ready to lose everything every day. Supposedly, he calmly committed suicide when ordered to do so by Emperor Nero.<br/>- Some things in nature (i.e. human weight and height) follow Gaussian distributions really well. Others, such as human wealth, aren’t even close<br/>- Luck is underrated in real life and overrated in games of chance. He talked about how two of the biggest financial loses a casino had were due to improperly filed tax forms, and an insurance claim related to a lion attack during a show, neither of which is related to gambling at all.<br/><br/>Interesting quotes:<br/>- “Everyone wants recognition, but we only glorify those who are loud.” - Taleb<br/>- “One death is a tragedy but a million is a statistic.” - Stalin<br/>- “People who worry about pennies instead of dollars are dangerous.” - Taleb",,,1,0

[…]. That's why it's so important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories”<br/>— Joshua Foer<br/><br/>A well written and unexpected story of how a journalist became the memory champion of the United States! The book has a good balance between the history of writing and memory training, the author’s personal experience in memory training, as well as interviews with well known figures in the the “memory athletics” space.<br/><br/>My biggest takeaway is that improving one’s memory is extremely difficult, and being a highly acclaimed memory athlete won’t necessarily translate to having a better memory for day-to-day tasks. The only way to truly remember something is to actively put a lot of mental effort into it. Since no one wants to read a book (which we presumably do for enjoyment) the way we read textbooks in school, it’s unlikely that we’ll retain most of the information we consume. Combined with the constant distractions of social media, and increasingly short attention spans, our ability to remember is dwindling away. For something to be remembered, it doesn’t only need to be read, it needs to be swelled upon. In other words, reading does not mean learning. Memorizing is not the same as understanding. Good memory does not necessarily translate to creativity or making connections. These ideas were reiterated throughout the book in many different forms.<br/><br/>Joshua Foer started the book with a few points that really hit home for me. Internal memory has been devalued ever since the world became literate, and has become even less prominent as our ability to externalize memories has improved. Rather than remembering things, we either write them down or remember where to find them (i.e. a Google search query). I write reviews for books I read, movies I watch, make notes for ideas I have, bookmark websites I like, use apps to track my tasks, etc… The only reason I do this is because I’m lazy. It’s much easier to take the time to organize my thoughts in this way than needing to remember everything. In fact, the reason I’m writing this right now is so that I won’t have to remember my opinion of the book in a few years. <br/><br/>The book quotes Socrates in saying that if we start writing everything down, we’ll become empty shells of our former selves. Writing was meant to aid in memorization, but has become a replacement for it… Even when it came to writing, we used to have wall paintings, then stone tablets, and later scrolls. Pages and books let us index this information so we’d have to remember even less. As an example, the author discusses how his recollection of the book “100 Years of Solitude” is of magical realism, but he couldn’t list any details in particular. All of these points make me really sad because they’re true! My only recollection of “100 Years of Solitude” isn’t any different, and sometimes I do feel like a shell that knows where to point but doesn’t actually hold any information of it’s own.<br/><br/>A key thing to remember is that the internationally recognized mental athletes do not necessarily have a bigger brain or are smarter in some way. They are individuals who have the willpower and grit to practice memorizing random things in a very specific set of scenarios: numbers, poems, letters, decks of cards, poems, etc… Similarly to how the strength of a power lifter in a squat rack with a well balanced olympic bar on his back may not necessarily translate to wits of strength in day-to-day tasks, mental athletes won’t be able to casually remember all the information they consume without the proper setup and concentration.Furthermore, similarly to how athletes need to take a rest the week before a major competition, mental athletes also stop training the week before a tournament and spend time clearing out their memory palaces.<br/><br/>======= Interesting Notes =======<br/><br/>Memory Tips & Tricks:<br/>- Remembering names: Use manufactured synesthesia (a mnemonic tool) to associate a name with a visual image. For example, “Joshua Foer” can be remember as “Joshing things into four pieces”.<br/>- Chunking: When memorizing a group of letters or numbers, chunking it into pieces is much easier. For example, 19921999 is hard to remember, but remembering it as two birth years (1992 and 1999) is much easier.<br/>- Memory palace: Since humans are good at remembering spatial information, we can use spatial information to provide visually organize unstructured data. The key to doing this successfully is to pick a location we are very well acquainted with (i.e. our childhood home), and start physically putting numbers/letters/cards/objects in points we will never forget.<br/>- Remember that we’re very good at remembering jokes and sexual things ;)<br/>- Alliteration aids with memory. This is why it’s so much easier to remember the text in chants and songs.<br/>- Associating text with emotion helps memorizing text. This is how actors manage to remember dozens of pages of scripts.<br/><br/>Stages of learning:<br/>- There are 3 stages to learning a new skill: Cognitive, Associated and Autonomous.<br/>- Experts in any field deliberately put effort into staying out of the autonomous stage to be able to keep improving.<br/>- The time put into practicing a skill is important, but may not necessarily translate to better results. Tl;dr Always pick quality over quantity.<br/>- Declarative memory: conscious.<br/>- Non-declarative memory: subconscious.<br/><br/>A very interesting exploration done by the author was on the mental abilities of those who are mentally handicapped:<br/>- A person who had a virus that damaged their hippocampus had no short term memory at all.<br/>- A person who had epileptic seizures as a child had some health issues, but an improved memory overall.<br/>- A child whose left and right hemispheres of the brain were not connected had the ability to memorize books word for word.<br/>- Damage to the left side of the brain puts a lot more emphasis on the right side of the brain. Individuals like these often experienced improved art or memory skills at very late stages in their life. This goes to show that such skills may lie dormant in all of us<br/><br/>Random interesting facts:<br/>- The brain only takes up 2% of our body mass, but consumes 20% of our oxygen intake and 33% of our energy.<br/>- Mark Twain was apparently really big on “memory hacks”.<br/>- One of the memory champions managed to memorized 30k digits of pie. However, when he discovered that a Japanese memory athlete had memorized 80k, he immediately gave up. It took him months to clear out his memory palace!<br/>- People are often impressed how chess grandmaster can play several games in parallel, even if blindfolded. While this is definitely impressive, it is not because their memories are that much better than ours. Through a lot of practice and the concept of chunking, every board they see is just a combination of other boards that they’ve seen in the past. New players interpret every single chess piece combination as something new. Similarly, if the chess pieces were moved around randomly, even the chess grandmasters would have a hard time remembering the layout.<br/>",,,1,0

My favorite part is how complimentary it is so Pixar’s story even after having read both “Creativity Inc” and “The Pixar Touch”.<br/><br/>I’m a lot more familiar with the career paths of well known individuals in STEM related fields (Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, Edward Thorpe, Ed Catmul, etc…), who start of being scrappy in a garage, with a big vision, facing a ton of financial and emotional hardships along the way and then somehow skyrocketing to success and fame when an inflection point occurs. Though Walt Disney’s story may have been similar, Bob Iger is a lot more “slow and steady” wins the race kind of individual, in an admirable way. He was very focused and worked hard throughout his whole career, always focusing on the task at hand while thinking about what’s next, but not letting his goals and ambitions take precedence of the here and now. In some sense, he is a “career media mogul”, where he slowly moved up the ranks, first at ABC and later at Disney. He never rushed anything and seems to have deserved all the success he has gained. When he became number two at ABC, he only had sports and the olympics under his belt. Though he didn’t have that much experience yet, people trusted his gut because he was pleasant to work with.<br/><br/>The book starts off a little depressing as Bob talks about the Orlando shootings, and the horror story where an alligator attacked a child at a Disney resort. This really sets the context that regardless of the upbeat image everyone associated with Disney, running an international company employing hundreds of thousands of people comes with a lot of hardships. Almost every political event will affect your employees and must be addressed. The corona virus is a growing epidemic at the time of this writing, and given that a Shanghai Disney resort opened up in 2016, I’m sure this is something that is top on Bob Iger’s priority list. The tone he uses throughout the book shows he has a lot of experience in dealing with matter like this, and how well trained he is at “political speak”.<br/><br/>Under Iger’s leadership, Disney turned from from a mammoth to a behemoth. He led many different acquisitions, the most prominent of which include Pixar, Marvel, LucasFilm and 21st Century Fox! The biggest surprise the book had opened up to me is how key personal relationships were to the success of all these acquisitions. Before the financials were sorted out, he had to personally convince the leader of each company that it was the right call:<br/>- Promise Steve Jobs that he was not trying to lowball or undervalue Pixar<br/>- Promise Ed Catmull that Pixar’s culture will remain separate and intact, since that is ultimately the reason for why they’re acquiring the company<br/>- Promise George Lucas that he will continue having creative input (as a consultant) even after the acquisition<br/><br/>There are many lessons sprinkled throughout the book that leaders need to keep in mind, and while they’re obvious, they’re much harder to implement in practice. Here are a few that stood out to me that I will keep in mind when I run my own team:<br/>- Don’t be a pessimist<br/>- Always be thoughtful and authentic<br/>- Excellence and perfection don’t have to be mutually exclusive<br/>- Need to be fair and kind, but still strive for perfection<br/>- Always own up to your mistakes<br/>- Bet on talent rather than experience<br/>- Projecting anxiety onto team and sharing that you have the same stress is different <br/>- There should only be a few (<5) top priorities. Do not present “secondary top priorities”!!!<br/>- Good leadership isn’t about being indispensable, but about helping others to potentially step into your shoes<br/>- *** It’s important to find a balance between management and impacting the creative process. It’s important to take risks, many of which will not work out.<br/><br/>My favorite quote from the book is “Don’t let ambition get ahead of opportunity.” Generally speaking, he suggests that we shouldn’t fixate on where we want to be but concentrate on our immediate responsibilities. Ambition becomes counterproductive and we become impatient if we focus too much on the future instead of the present. And lastly, he says: “the moment you see a title on your forehead, you’ve lost your way.”",,,1,0

Harris,"Harris, Blake J.",,"=""0062455982""","=""9780062455987""",5,4.04,Dey Street Books,ebook,528,2019,,2020/01/03,2019/08/10,,,read,"An easy listening fun book that provides a lot of context into how the Virtual Reality revolution was re-triggered in the early 2010s with the founding of Oculus. As someone who works in the industry, I still learnt a whole lot and was surprised by how many different key players were involved in its founding. The first half of the book is an exciting and motivating startup story that I couldn’t stop listening to, while the second half was ridden with large company politics and bureaucracy which, unfortunately, cannot be avoided when an organization exceeds a certain size.<br/><br/>Palmer Lucky - Prior to reading the book, I thought of Palmer Lucky as the mastermind behind Oculus and all of its operations. I had seen him in some keynotes, but did not extensively listen to his interviews. After reading the book, my respect for him has ten folded! He is a very sterotipycal “kid genius”, with a low ego, who is simply interested in doing fun, interesting work and does not care for reputation, politics, beurocarcy, money, etc… Living in a trailer, he never cared for fine things before he was rich, and that didn’t seem to change even after Oculus’ acquisition. He was part of a bunch of online communicates, and is a hacker at heart. This really helped me resonate with his character. He was home-schooled, never went to college, but doesn’t make a big deal out of it. Being a self-learner is a lot more admirable and difficult that going down the “traditional” path. It goes along with Paul Grahama’s “Bus Ticket Theory”, where Palmer was motivated and driven by an intrinsic interest to make VR happen moreso than becoming successful.<br/><br/>John Carmack - Alongside Palmer Lucky and the other founders, John Carmack is in the limelight of the book. As an amazing programmer, known for Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein and now Oculus, he is a legend in the gaming Community. He is blunt, proactive, curious, and is someone I very much look up to. Even as the CTO of Oculus, he still spent a good portion of his time writing code, which is extremely uncommon for people with that level of seniority. In between his blockbuster successes, he does investigative projects (i.e. space travel) which often fail, but it is admirable that he is willing to put the time and money into it. Interestingly, he was a core inspiration for both the author of Ready Player One and Palmer (the creator of the Oculus DK1 prototype), which were being developed around the exact same time. He is the epidimy of someone who says things like they are, does not let success go to his head, and truly follows his passion.<br/><br/>John + Palmer - Though John Carmack was already a prominent figure prior to the story of Oculus, Palmer was not. However, their initial online encounter and collaboration feels very fun and innocent. Palmer simply shipped the first Oculus prototype to John, John ported Doom 3 BFG to work on it, added a couple sensors and demoed it an CES. The low price and great field of view was so good that Sony had immediately offered a job for $70K. When Palmer rejected, they upped the compensation to $140K. As we know now, even the counteroffer was a ridiculously large lowball. There were many  legal implications between Zenimax and Facebook after the fact, but it’s inspiring to see things got started.<br/><br/>VR history - The book does a good job and setting some context into the history of VR, but I would not have been opposed to more :). VR headsets have been around since the 1950s, when they were so heavy they had to be hung from the ceiling. Shortly before Oculus, the military was paying 10s or 100s of thousands of dollars for VR headsets for training. People like Mark Bolas (who helped Palmer get started) have been researching and pushing for this field for many decades, so it’s exciting to live during a time when this technology is on the precipice of becoming mainstream.<br/><br/>Brendan Iribe and Michael Antonov - I didn’t know much about Brenda and Michael prior to the book, but am impressed by their background. Though the didn’t ignite the sparks to bring up Oculus, they were the very first twigs necessary for something to catch on fire. Later on, Facebook provided the logs to keep the fire burning. Scaleform was a hugely successful company, supporting iconic games like Civilization, Crysis, Fable, so they had obviously played (no pun intended) a larger role in my childhood without me even knowing. After being acquired by Autodesk and having financial freedom, they were key in convincing lucky to go down the startup route. If it weren’t for them, Oculus may have	stalled at the “hardware prototype” phase.<br/><br/>Ooya - I was following the Ooya console very closely in its early kickstarter days and as the company died out. It’s unfortunate how things turned out, but I believe it goes to show how important the resources, support and longevity huge corporations (i.e. Facebook) can provide for innovative products. Even though Oculus hasn’t penetrated the mainstream yet, I believe it would be doing much more poorly if it hadn’t been for Facebook’s acquisition. I honestly believe it’s the right move if you have the industry’s interest at heart.<br/><br/>Nimble America Debacle - Everything surrounding Lucky’s donation to Nimble America really frustrated me… It shows how the Bay Area has come to push forward for diversity of backgrounds and opinions, but ONLY if it is the right one. Lucky stood up and supported for what he believed in, did so in a very respectful way, tried to be honest, frank and transparent with everyone he spoke to, but it still all backfired. This part of the book was longer than I had hoped, and it seems like there were some behind the scene politics not covered, but I can’t say I enjoyed it very much… Ultimately, I’m really upset and how Facebook’s management chain chose to handle and attempt to “fix” the situation.<br/><br/>Valve - Prior to reading the book, I knew that Valve had a flat company structure, but did not know much more. It’s fascinating how a company with no plans or management manages to get things done. It seems like there always needs to be some individual who can “romance” others into helping/supporting them into whatever project they’re working on, so it makes sense why things worked out the way they did.  However, who’s passionate about fixing bugs? The book mentions how Michael Abrash had originally rejected Lucky for a job, prior to John Carmack’s introduction, since he didn’t have a proven track record.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg - Congress and many “privacy advocates” see Mark Zuckerberg as a bad actor, and even the book sometimes portrays him as someone who is unwilling to compromise. However, it’s very important to remember what a difficult position he is in every day. Given the number of people his decisions and statements affect, and the amount of wealth he has accumulated, every action he takes will both hurt/benefit anger/excite many. Moments such as ordering pizza during the M&A talks in his backyard, or bringing Macdonalds takeout when he visited the Oculus office make him seem like just another guy. With that said, forcing others to publicly post opinions that differ from their own crosses the line. It is very difficult to be in his position, and he will never be able to please everyone…<br/><br/>Random facts<br/>- Facebook considered buying Unity early on!<br/>- In order to bypass Facebook’s store policy, Palmer came up with the idea of side loading apps by allowing installations from untrusted developers. So simple, yet also so effective!<br/>- To date, HTC’s Gear VR is still Oculus’ biggest competitor. It is interesting how the CEO of HTC specifically went on an around-the-world trip to determine what technology to invest in next.<br/>- 5ms latency is what you need to avoid motion sickness<br/>- Paul Bettner, the founder of Words with Friends, supposedly managed to raise the acquisition of his company from $20MM to $180MM while negotiating with Zynga. Crazy!<br/>- Masahiro Sakurai, a prolific game designer at Nintendo, is supposedly very interested in VR, but does not take on a project unless he knows that the potential audience is large enough.<br/>",,,1,0

It started concentrating solely on political and scientific tensions in China. Then the author started sprinkling in bits of sci-fi and Fantasy to intrigue the reader. This was followed by several fascinating trips into the world of the Three Body Problem, which is very appropriate given the advent of VR around the time this book was written and released.

There is a missed opportunity to influence our opinions by simply taking a little bit of extra effort to make a great moment an outstanding one. More specifically, having an overall high quality experience is not as memorable as having an average quality experience interspersed with magical moments. I learnt a very important lesson from reading this book, but I only made it about 70% through because it got extremely boring and repetitive. While I haven’t used a service like blinkist myself, I believe this book could be summarized into 15-20 minutes and one would not miss out on much.<br/><br/>Most memorable quote from the book: “[Life is] Mostly forgettable and occasionally remarkable .”<br/><br/>==== Powerful Moments from the book ====<br/><br/>Reminiscence bump: Most adults have a strong and positive recollection of their early adulthood. This is due to the fact that between the ages of 15-30, we experience a lot of firsts: first day in college, first job, first love, first sexual experience, etc… Novelty is very powerful, but it doesn’t have to end in adolescence if we simply put in the effort to look for newer experiences. I believe this is the reason why so many people in their late 20s and 30s start traveling and long for new experiences: you have to put in effort to experience something new, whereas in higschool new experiences simply fell on our laps.<br/><br/>Peak-end rule: The author discussed how humans tend to neglect duration due to the peak-end rule. For example, most people forget the hours of waiting in line at Disney because we only recall the 15 magical minutes once we are on the ride. Another example is the popsicle hotline which turned an average hotel in LA into one of the most popular hotels in LA on trip advisor. All they had to do was deliver popsicles on a platter by the poolside whenever somebody picks up the phone.<br/><br/>Arbitrrary milestones:  Turning 50 years old or celebrating a 50th wedding anniversary are pretty arbitrary milestones. Nothing in the individual’s life changes. However, it gives us reason to celebrate, remember and create a powerful moment on which we can look back on. In addition, milestones also drive us to complete things. If we have an arbitrary deadline, or a new year’s resolution, people tend to obsess with completing it on time.<br/><br/>Banking missed opportunities: Most of our interactions with banks are not something we look forward to. At little to no cost, banks can make their interactions with customers much more enjoyable. For example, celebrating an individual’s first or last mortgage payment with a small present (i.e. a free coffee). The author also mentioned how a bank could celebrate a child’s initiative to start saving by rounding up $13 of savings to $20 when they take the first step to becoming financially responsible in their life. These small cheap actions are priceless, and are moments which we’ll forever remember and shape our opinion of the bank. The kid who opened up his savings account at 13 might pick the same bank to open up a mortgage 20 years later. <br/><br/>Break the script: Similarly to the idea of missed opportunities, breaking the script also creates powerful and memorable moments. For example, letting a waiter hand out occasional free desserts is quite different from a loyalty where you work your way to a free dessert. While both surprise and gamification have a time and place, simply doing something that is different from the norm can have positive effects.<br/><br/>Responsibility: Though everyone is responsible for doing their job, it is no one’s responsibility to create “peaks” in their day-to-day work. It requires more physical and emotional effort, and we do not get paid for it. For example, a coworker of mine recently hosted a weekend long hackathon at work.

In my personal opinion, the book shows that Andrew is a down to earth, intelligent, kind, self-made entrepreneur who truly understands how our economy and society function. He puts politics and bullshit aside, tries to avoid making false promises, and is solely interested in making the US, and indirectly the rest of the world, a better place for future generations. He is the only candidate who understands how big tech works, and who truly understands the day-to-day problems millennials and gen-Zs are facing.<br/><br/>As an honorary #YangGang member (not a US citizen and therefore cannot vote) who has become obsessed with listening to Yang interviews, I was looking for a source where Andrew has the ability to go in depth on everything he believes in and why. If that’s what you’re looking for, this book will satisfy that craving.<br/><br/>Short Background - As the child of immigrants who grew up in a small rural town, faced some racism growing up, there is a sense that Andrew came from humble beginnings. He studied, worked hard, became a lawyer, worked at a healthcare company, launched an education startup and has done a lot more. He is a successful self-made entrepreneur living the “American dream”.  Most importantly, he doesn’t feel like a career politician who’s ambitions were ever to enter the White House. Through experience, he discovered the problems that Americans are facing and genuinely wants to solve them.<br/><br/>Wealth Inequality - I resonated a lot with Andrew’s point of view on America’s wealth gap. There is no question that the wealth gap in American, and the rest of the world is widening, which is indeed a problem. However, Capitalism is working well and Americans have a higher standard of living than they ever have before. With that being said, the new generation is set up for failure. Housing and education is becoming increasingly unaffordable, and it is unlikely to change in the near future. Andrew points out that people born in the 1940s had a 92% chance of earning more than their parents, where those who were born in the 1990s only had a 40% chance of earning more than their parents.<br/><br/>Is this time different? - Andrew discussed how there was a lot of fear during the industrial revolution that machines would overtake all human jobs. While the agriculture industry did dwindle from a peak of 40% to 2% of the US’s economy, new jobs were created. He argues that the advent of the internet , ML and AI is different however, and that this time, the number of new jobs created will be far less than the number that is automated away. There is no way to predict the future, but I disagree for two reasons:<br/>- There is a famous saying I hear successful entrepreneurs repeating over and over: “history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes”. Why should this time be different?<br/>- As someone who work closely with ML & AI researchers, I know how far with are from general AI. From my emperical experience, I believe we are going to move to an “ML/AI assisted” world, where AI acts as an aid to humans, but we are hundreds of years away from AI replacing us.<br/><br/>Silicon Valley - It’s undebatable that big tech (FANG companies, etc…) play a huge role in shaping our economy, society and politics on a global scale. Any leader in a major economic power today needs to have a firm grasp and understanding of how these companies function. With some politicians claiming that big tech should be broken up, others speaking in very abstract terms, and some just having no clue as to what’s going on, Andrew proves that how grounded he is with the “lay man”. As a tech employee, I could related to everything he said about tech employees. I won’t delve into the details, but all I can say is that he gets it.<br/><br/>Alaska petroleum dividend  - Alaska has a trust funded by oil revenues that pays out a dividend to all employees. In a way, this is a form of UBI that has been around since the 1970s. Crazy!<br/><br/>Time Baking - I wasn’t familiar with Edgar Cahn’s Time Banking concepts prior to this book. The idea is that currency is time-based: you do 1 hour of work for someone in exchange to get 1 hour of work back from someone else. This was fun to learn about, but it goes against capitalism: it does not promote entrepreneurship and values everyone’s time identically. Sounds very Marxist to me…",,,1,0
34466963,Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams,Matthew Walker,"Walker, Matthew",,"=""""","=""""",5,4.38,Scribner,Hardcover,368,2017,2017,2019/10/03,2019/08/17,,,read,"An absolute must read for everyone!!! This book made me realize how little awareness there is on the importance of sleep. School curriculums cover a variety of topics including sex education, health & fitness, drug use, etc…. However, I don’t know of any country that covers sleep, a fundamental component of our daily routine, comprising almost a third of our entire lives, in their educational curriculum.<br/><br/>This book is the best source of information I’ve encountered on the topic of sleep. It is extremely well balanced between scientific information, actionable advice, and ongoing empirical evidence from recent studies. Unlike other books I’ve tried to read related to neuroscience, this one is neither too scientifically terse, nor too “hand-wavy”.<br/><br/>My biggest takeaway was that if we do everything right in life (eat well, exercise, meditate, stay focused, work smart/hard, etc…), the fruits of our labour won’t be nearly as large if we also don’t also supplement it with sufficient sleep. A lack of sleep will cause you to gain weight more easily, make you more emotionally unstable, make it more difficult to remember things, lead to less creative ideas, and make it more difficult to improve in whatever mental or physical goals one may have.<br/><br/>My favorite anecdote from the book was one about Thomas Edison. He was supposedly a short night time sleeper, but a habitual daytime napper. During his naps, he would hold a metal bearing in his hand. The moment he would fall asleep, which naturally caused him to lose muscle tone, the sound of the dropping ball caused a noise loud enough such that he woke up. Upon waking up, he immediately wrote down all the ideas that came to his mind.<br/><br/>As a software engineer, I kept drawing comparisons between sleep and garbage collection. There is no such thing as a good software, and similarly, there is no such thing as a good biological organism. It kind of works, evolves over time, hacks and workarounds keep building on top of each other, and common patterns emerge. In order for a dolphin to achieve NREM sleep underwater, they can only do so with half a brain at a time. Some people may see this as a brilliant evolutionary adaptation, but another way of looking at it is as a hack where a mission critical system can’t shut down, but is also out of resources.<br/><br/>I’ve seen a lot of “faux-science” related to sleep over the years, but Matthew Walker’s book is by far the closest thing we have have to a “Sleep Bible”.  He makes it very clear throughout the book how much more there is to learn. The state of research on sleep is still in its infancy, and it feels as though he is constantly alluding to a sequel that may come out in a couple decades. One thing is clear though: sleep is one of the most important factors we can and should control. It is crazy to think that humans are the only animals who deprive themselves of sleep, especially given that it’s “near impossible” (according to the author) to simply catch up on lost sleep.<br/><br/>====== Notes Below ====== <br/><br/>Pro Tips For Good Sleep<br/>1. Complete darkness - buy blackout curtains if necessary<br/>2. Take a hot bath to relax and reduce your inner body temperature before sleep<br/>3. Reduce the temperature of your surroundings to approximately 18.5C<br/>4. Avoid caffeinated drinks up to 8 hours before bedtime<br/>5. Don’t be too full, nor too hungry<br/>6. Wash your hands and face before bed to reduce the temperature of your extremities.<br/><br/>Larks vs Night Owls<br/>I typically sleep between 11:30pm and 7:00am. As a Lark, I’ve always looked at Night Owls as people who constantly procrastinate and can’t commit to a reasonable day/night schedule. Shamefully, I have to admit what a poor point of view that was… From an evolutionary standpoint, Night Owls were the ones who kept guard at night while the Larks went to bed early. This is a brilliant evolutionary survival tactic. It is very sad that Night Owls are forced to deprive themselves of sleep by adapting to the “modern day standards” of the start and end of a workday. This can only lead to health issues and this is why flexible work hours are so much better. <br/><br/>Larks or Night Owls, humans also evolved to have a mid afternoon nap. This is often why energy levels dip in the afternoon, and why the “4 o’clock coffee” is a known widespread concept. It it sad that our society is depriving us of this…<br/><br/>The Chemistry Of Sleep<br/>Melatonin, adenosine and caffeine are the three key chemicals involved in either promoting or inhibiting sleep.<br/><br/>Adenosine is a chemical that builds up while we are awake, and is dissipated away while we sleep. On days when we are very active (i.e. a long hike), it builds up faster, which explains why we are exhausted by the end of the day. Similarly, if we don’t get a full night of sleep, an insufficient amount of it dissipates away, which is why we remain tired.<br/><br/>Caffeine, which needs no introduction, binds to the same receptors as adenosine. Since the receptors get blocked, it temporarily prevents us from being tired. It is fascinating to think that this basic function has made it the second most traded commodity on earth, second only to oil.<br/><br/>Fun fact: The author mentioned a study done by NASA on spiders who were exposed to caffeine. Spiders on caffeine cannot make a spider web at all, which is a tad concerning…<br/><br/>Melatonin is a hormone that “kicks off sleep” and it only gets produced in complete darkness. The smallest bit of light, especially blue LED light produced by phones, inhibits melatonin production. This is one of the reasons why darkness is so vital for a good night’s sleep. <br/><br/>One of the topics I wish the author had discussed in more depth are the quantitative numbers, limits, and impacts of drinking coffee or taking melatonin pills. How much coffee is too much? Are melatonin pills okay? If so, at what dosage?<br/><br/>NREM vs REM sleep<br/><br/>Our brain continuously switches between REM sleep and NREM sleep. In terms of information processing, a high level way of thinking about it is:<br/>1. Wake state: reception of new information<br/>2. NREM sleep: Storage of new information from short term to long term memory. Solidifies memories.<br/>3. REM sleep: Integration of new data with old experiences. Creates creative connections.<br/><br/>As we get older, we get less and less deep sleep. More precisely, we lose approximately 80-90% of our deep sleep by the age of 80…<br/><br/>NREM Sleep<br/><br/>Muscle tone is often maintained during NREM sleep, there is no dreaming, and that is primarily when growth hormone is secreted.<br/><br/>NREM sleep can be achieved with only half the brain if necessary. Dolphins, for example, achieve NREM sleep with half a brain at a time, because the other half is necessary to maintain life preserving activities in the water. Birds on a wire do something even more fascinating. The birds on opposite end of a long line sleep with half a brain, keeping one eye out for predators, while all the birds in the middle are able to get full sleep with both parts of the brain at the same time.<br/><br/>Birds on transcontinental flights achieve NREM sleep by taking ultra small naps (while flying) that last seconds. As short as this is, it is sufficient for whatever NREM sleep needs to do.<br/><br/>A 2006 German study sent electrical stimulus to the brain during NREM sync with a function that was in sync with that of the brain. This resulted in a 40% increase in memory! Even though these studies are still questionable and have a lot of work ahead, I’m really excited for what’s on the horizon.<br/><br/>REM Sleep<br/><br/>Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is a special type of sleep that requires both parts of the brain. It is not present in amphibians or water based animals. It is the only time humans dream. It also completely parallelizes the body when a person enters this mode of sleep.<br/><br/>The main purpose of REM sleep, as far as we know, is creativity. A few of the most famous examples include the fact that the periodic table of elements conceived by Dmitri Mendeleev came to him in his sleep. John Lennon, amongst several other musicians, also claim to have come up with iconic songs in their sleep and recorded them, sometimes without recollection, immediately upon waking.<br/> <br/>REM sleep parallelizes the body so we do not move or react to events happening in our dreams. It is worth mentioning that the Homo Erectus was the first dedicated group sleeper, because muscle tone cannot be lost when you are on a tree.<br/><br/>Sea animals cannot enter REM sleep since bodily functions are always necessary for survival underwater. Interestingly enough, some animals such as seals, who can live both under or above water experience little to no REM sleep while underwater and a normal amount when they are above.<br/><br/>Time Tracking during sleep<br/><br/>An unexplained phenomenon is time dilation during sleep. Some people claim to have lived a thousand years, while others experience a single minute throughout a full night’s sleep. Simultaneously, our bodies are able to keep some sort of biological clock, which is why we often find ourselves waking up a couple minutes before the moment the alarm clock is set to go off.<br/><br/>Practice doesn’t make perfect, practice+sleep makes perfect<br/><br/>Motor functions are improved in the last two hours of sleep.  Anyone who is practicing a new skill (athletes who are training, babies learning to walk, musicians practicing a new piece, etc…) need to sleep to solidify those skills. Individuals can practice a new skill the whole day and see little to no improvement towards the end of the day. It is likely that they may get tired or that their brain has not made the proper connections to master the skill. The last two hours of sleep, which a lot of people unfortunately miss, is the moment when these new skills are mastered. For example, the author mentioned a pianist who would only be able to “master” a musical piece upon waking, rather than in the evening after a full day of training.<br/><br/>Alcohol<br/><br/>Drinking alcohol in the evenings before bed is a very common and socially acceptable phenomena, so I was saddened to find out how bed it really is…. Alcohol is one of he strongest inhibitors of REM sleep, which means that we can’t make any new “brain connections” if we drink before bed. Moreover, drinking before bed can cause problems in the connections we make based on information we received from a few days ago. This means that if you were were preparing on Tuesday for a test that’s happening the following Monday, drinking before bed on Friday night could have implications regarding how much information you retain. The only workaround for this is to drink sufficiently early in the day such that the alcohol is fully digested by the time you go to sleep. Brunch samosas anyone?<br/><br/>I know that being healthy during pregnancy is very important, but this book made me fear for every child whose mother has a glass of wine while they’re pregnant. Alcohol can very readily transmits through the placenta layer. Seeing how fetuses spend almost all their time in REM sleep, and brain development is vital during pregnancy, any bit of alcohol can have huge longterm implications on the child’s development.<br/><br/>DD: Drunk Driving vs Drowzy Driving<br/><br/>The author pointed to several studies proving that drowsy driving is as bad, if not worse, than drunk driving. If driving is really a necessity, taking a 30 minute nap is the best thing you can do. The author does recommend to wait an extra 20 minutes after waking for the sleep inertia to dissipate. The author also mentioned that the equivalent of a breathalyzer for alcohol may be coming for sleep sooner than we might expect.<br/><br/>One of the interesting ideas that was brought up in this chapter is the fact that insurance does not take sleep patterns into consideration. Insurance companies look at age, health, fitness, and much more. Sleep arguably plays a much bigger role than all of those, so why is it so under the radar?<br/><br/>Emotion<br/><br/>The Amygdala, a part of the brain responsible for managing emotional balance, is a lot more responsive in sleep deprived patients. This might explain why sleep deprived humans are more likely to “snap”.<br/><br/>There’s a saying that “time heals all wounds”, but it very much seems that time, with the aid of sleep, is what ultimately heals wounds. It is near impossible to be mentally or emotionally stable without sufficient sleep.<br/><br/>The author mentions that there are studies which have shown how sleep deprivation can act as an antidepressant, but it seems to be true for a very small number of people. One of the reasons I loved this book is because the author constantly kept bringing up examples like these. He was able to simultaneously show how little and how much we know about sleep, and paved the way for a followup book sometime in the distant future :)<br/><br/>Cancer<br/><br/>Cancer was touched on several times throughout the book. The main takeaway was that less sleep leads to a higher risk of cancer and a shorter life span. There are humans case studies and rat experiments supporting this. However, I feel like almost anything nowadays leads to a higher risk of cancer, so I’m not too sure how much to read into this...<br/><br/>Exercise<br/>There wasn’t a lot of evidence in the book suggesting that exercise leads to better sleep. Perhaps exercise causes more adenosine to build up in a shorter time period, which indirectly leads to better sleep. However, there was a directly correlation between sleep quality and exercise the following day. A bad night’s sleep definitely makes it more difficult to exercise the following day.<br/><br/>Adolescence, Age and Sleep<br/><br/>The author spent a fair amount of time discussing the changes in sleep pattern sthat take place during adolescence. <br/><br/>The circadian rhythm in children runs on an early schedule. However, when children reach adolescence, during puberty, the timing of the supercharysmatic nucleus moves forward a lot. This causes teens to start going to sleep later and waking up later. The exact reasoning for this is not clear, but there are some theories that it is an opportunity for kids to spend more time away from parents and learn to be on their own.<br/><br/>Seeing how the brain continues to develop and mature into our mid 20s, an insufficient amount of sleep at this age can easily increase the likelihood of mental diseases in the future.<br/><br/>In adults, melatonin is released much earlier in the day, which is why it’s common for them to fall asleep on the couch.<br/><br/>Random Points<br/>- Some prisons implement the “no uninterrupted sleep” policy. A method of holding people hostage and making them go crazy is simply by not letting them get uninterrupted sleep.<br/>- The longest period without sleep was removed from the Guinness book of world records. This shows how unhealthy of a task it is.<br/>- Modern MRI scanning techniques can detect the subject of our dream. It is very coarse, but some experiments can determine if a person is, for example, dreaming about a car.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

33606119,Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race,Reni Eddo-Lodge,"Eddo-Lodge, Reni",,"=""140887055X""","=""9781408870556""",3,4.39,Bloomsbury Circus,Hardcover,249,2017,2017,,2019/07/24,,,read,"A short book that I did not enjoy very much but forced myself to finish as per the recommendation of a friend. The book really brings to light how powerful institutional white racism is still to this day, and does a great job at discerning between racism, ignorance to racism, activism and “color blindness”. I used to think that I should try to avoid seeing race altogether, but this book tipped me very slightly on the side of affirmative action. That being said, a lot of the examples used throughout the book are dated, since a lot has changed in the past 30 years, which weakened the author’s argument in some cases.<br/><br/>There are two primary audience: those who can relate to the author and those to whom the book was recommended by individuals who could related to the author. I am one of the latter. As a single straight white male, in his 20s, working for a large tech company, who mostly grew up in Canada, and is currently living in the US, with physically conservative and social liberal views, I often feel like I’m not allowed to have views that challenge the status quo whatsoever. This book reiterated that point. Having grown up in a very multicultural environment, and having gone through many “unconscious bias” training sessions at work, I like to think that I treat everyone equally, but I know that I’m biased. As a Russian Jew, I have a preference of dating women who are also Russian Jewish. When I meet someone new, I immediately connect them mores if we are of a similar background, race or heritage. Whenever I interview someone at work, I actively remind myself not to prefer one person over another because of their race. This takes conscious effort, and I’m not sure if it’ll ever change. The book made a point that simply being ignorant of race altogether is not ideal because we have not reached equality yet, so it might be a good thing. While I do not plan to become an activist of this movement, this book definitely shaped how I think about race.<br/><br/>A  major concept that irritated me throughout this book is the author’s insistence that the only type of racial description that takes place is that which is most visible - individuals who are of a dark skin color. However, while I am white and can therefore “hide” my race, being a Russian Jew has also had it’s downside and I feel the need to express that. My parents and grandparents were Jewish citizens o the USSR. Though everyone is technically “white”, their passport read “Jew”. Some Universities did not accept Jews at all, others only had a limited number of spots for Jews, and sometime their grades were also affected by this fact. Similar to how slavery was considered part of the norm a couple hundred years ago, this was part of the norm in the USSR 30 years ago. After the Perestroika, my family and I moved to Israel while I was still a toddler. When I was 4, I would always come home and jump straight into the shower. My mom tried to figure out why that was, and we later found out that some of the Israelis were calling me a “Stinky Russian”, even though we were all Jewish. Though I attended a Jewish school, I grew up in an Arabic community and was constantly bullied for being Jewish. I was never beat up, but constantly teased, pushed around and made fun of, which is traumatic for a child.. While I realize that this doesn’t compare to the type of racism colored people must endure, I think it’s important to raise awareness that there are different types of “white” as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe that I’m one of the people Reni would not want to talk to about Race. She is right in saying that I’ll never understand what she and others are constantly going through. I have no pity, but am annoyed that this still takes place. My biggest takeaway is that I should not strive for “color blindness”, but for “color quality”. <br/><br/>=== Random points from that book that I found interesting ===<br/>- The discussion about the distinction between institutional racism and racial disadvantage was very interesting <br/>- Racism is often confused for prejudice, which is not the same<br/>- Black history month is, unfortunately, slowly turning into black culture month in a lot of schools<br/>- Color blindness is not necessary good - seeing race is necessary to change the system<br/>- The analogy of “white privlerage” to making an educational facility being wheelchair accessible was very profound<br/>",,,1,0

The author definitely intended, or had hoped, that it would be converted into a movie. Surprisingly, the news that a limited series is going to be developed was announced on August 1st 2019, only a couple weeks after I finished reading it! I personally think that this book is better consumed through audio rather than text because the different voices and accents in the audible make a big difference.<br/><br/>The topics covered in this book are very complimentary to the rise and fall of Atari covered in Adam Fisher’s valley of genius. After Atari’s immense success in the early 80s, followed by a huge failure where they burried 3 million copies of the ET video game in a landfill, the seeds for the gaming industry were planted. However, several years of “gaming winter” took place where everyone had thought that the gaming industry was dead. Out of those ashes, Nintendo flourished and became the dominant player. Nintendo made the industry a multibillion dollar company, and Sega ended up being a powerful but short “blimp” the shadowed in Nintendo’s longterm success.<br/><br/>It was both sad and exciting to see how much Sega was able to achieve and lose in a very short period of time. The biggest lesson for me is how important quality and a longterm vision is. Sega’s quality and standards were lower, and they were trying to beat their competitor through strategic advertising. While this could work in the short-term, it is not a sunstaibale longterm model, and I believe this applies to any product or business. In fact, in 1993, Sega had 50% of the American video game industry and 15% of the Japanese video game industry. With numbers like these, it’s hard to believe that they essentially evaporated…<br/><br/>One of the most fascinating things about the book is how important distribution and relationship with retailers were back then. Before direct to consumer sales, the internet, or online purchases, major retailers such as Target or Walmart could make or break a company.<br/><br/>After finishing the book, I found an online emulator for the Sega genesis and tried playing a couple of the old games. All I can say is that I’m really glad how far games have come. In particular, the video game music in the early 90s was simply horrific…<br/><br/>Favorite quote from the book: “The name of the game is the game.”<br/><br/>===== Interesting Facts from the book ===== <br/><br/>Tom Kolinsky<br/>- Tom oversaw A LOT of things prior to his gig at Sega:<br/>    - Marketing and growth of the infamous Baby doll<br/>    - Handheld devices at Mattel<br/>    - Flintstone vitamins, etc…<br/>- The whole “scene” where Tom gets offered to be president of Sega USA by Nakayama while vacationing on the beach in Hawaii with his family is very movie-esque. Whether or not it was true, I loved it!<br/>- On several occasions, it was repeated that Kolinsky always hid the bad news from his team and tried to put a positive spin when delivering bad news or changes to his direct reports. There were a lot of useful management lessons interspersed throughout the book and I really learned to respect and admire Tom.<br/><br/>Nintendo: <br/>- Nintendo stands for “leave luck to heaven”<br/>- The company started out by selling playing cards in Japan when they were illegal in the 1800s<br/>- Nintendo’s first successor after it’s original founder had passed away was his 21 year old son in law who fired all of the old management and made the company what it is today<br/>- For a long time, Nintendo was just a small company making arcade games<br/>- In the post modem of Atari’s “death”, there was a huge boom in whereby Nintendo started makings 10s of millions in software and birthed a multibillion dollar industry<br/>- For some reason, Nintendo always understocked it’s hardware and games<br/>- Nintendo’s Donkey Kong country was the first game to have an online launch and chat. It had 2.3M live simultaneous users online and done via compuserve<br/>- Nintendo had the balls to stop selling to target to stand firm on their return policy <br/><br/>Sonic<br/>- Sonic’s original name was Mr. Needlemouse<br/>- The creator of Sonic came up with the concept by overlaying Mickey Mouse with Garfield the cat<br/>- The primary reason Sega created Sonic was to compete with Nintendo’s Mario<br/>- The original version of Sonic presented by Nakimaya was a goth, with sharp teeth, an electric guitar, and a lady friend named Madonna. Tom Kolinsky persuaded Sega Japan to make him more PG13 for the USA launch.<br/>- Sonic Tuesday!<br/><br/>Sega<br/>- Sega originally started out as a coin operated photo booth machine to create IDs in Japan. They slowly shifted to video games when Atari started building arcade games. Ben Rosen acquired Nakiyama’s company when it started posing a threat.<br/>- In its early days, Sega invested heavily in VR, but it didn’t go anywhere…<br/>- In 1992, Sega partnered with Disney to make the Aladdin video game. I remember this game :)<br/>- SOJ rejected a parternship with both Sony and SGI, which may have been a reason for its death. Simultaneously, Nintendo agreed to partner with SGI - an American company.<br/><br/>Retailers<br/>- Initially, Walmart was too afraid to sell sega console in its stored because Nintendo accounted for 10% of their profits<br/>- Due to the difficulty of logistics in the early 90s, there was never a specific date for game release. Inventory simply started showing within some time range.<br/>- Nintendo owners would buy a console, use it for several years and then try to return it when a new version came out. This led to a long battle between retailers such as Target, who have liberal return policies.<br/>- Nintendo never allowed its retailers to markdown their products unless they did it at their own cost<br/><br/>Politics<br/>There was so much politics and bureaucracy throughout the book that it almost made me want to gag…<br/>- The creator of sonic quit SOJ because he had no recognition, no compensation, and a very small team… He ultimately joined SOA to build the sequel on much better terms.<br/>- Sega was sponsoring an event on aids prevention just to raise the profile for the company<br/>- Sega hosted an event for all retailers at Boca Raton to get on everyone’s “good side”<br/>- The whole Japanese board often disagreed with Tom’s ideas (lose money on hardware, give away sonic for free, target everyone other than kids, etc…) but Nakiyama had his back<br/>",,,1,0

As a relatively non-empathetic or emotional individual, who tries to reason through most problems from a logical perspective, this book was very eye opening. However, I can see how this book would fall into the category of “stating out the obvious” for many. It’ll probably be a very boring and frustrating read for people who are naturally good at supporting or sympathizing with others. For those who are not though, this book re-iterates that humans are emotional beings, and provides many anecdotes on how to build good culture, relate and bond with the team.<br/><br/>The main point Kim Scott was trying to iterate throughout the book is that emotional labour is part of a manager’s job. The human factor is very important, and at the end of the day, managers need to care. They need to be able to care about people while also be willing to be hated in return. The boss needs to take all the hits of the team, and not expect any praise in return. There were also numerous times when she wrote that a manager needs to eliminate the phrase “don’t take it personally” from their vocabulary. All of this is extremely obvious and may seem like common sense, but it doesn’t come as easy to some as it does to others. Sometimes, one simply needs to have the obvious repeated several times before they implement it in practice.<br/><br/>Aside from the lessons Kim Scott delivers, I was also very impressed by her career path and track record. She started working with coal miners in Russia in the early 90s. She led a very large portion of the advertising organization at Google under the supervision of Sherryl Sandberg, while interacting directly with Sergey Brin and Larry Page.  She was a member of the faculty at Apple, and was offered the position of Twitter’s CEO at one point in time. Everywhere she went, she empowered and supported her team, built candor relationships, and also put her family life (having children) first whenever necessary.<br/><br/>The first half of the book was very captivating, having a great mix of anecdotes and lessons. The second half seemed to repeat a lot of the core concepts. Though it did help solidify the concepts, it still felt repetitive.<br/><br/>Having worked at Twitter early in my career, I was able to relate to a lot of Kim’s stories on a personal level. I used to do crossfit with Dick Costolo and Russ Laraway, so it was very interesting to learn more about them from a business perspective. It was cool to learn that Dick has an almost perfect score in unconscious bias, and I was glad to hear about Russ’ success after leaving Twitter.<br/><br/>======= Points that stood out======= <br/><br/>*  Random advice<br/>- A boss needs to take al the hits for his or her team<br/>- Emails with feedback should not be personalized - the company policies and mission should be discussed instead<br/>- Do not be defensive when receiving radically candid feedback, but do defend others<br/>- There is a difference between being a competent asshole or an incompetent caring person<br/>- Providing praise or positive feedback without actually caring is just as bad as not saying anything at all<br/>- Radical candor without caring is simply obnoxious aggression<br/>- Being an absentee manager is just as bad as being a micro manager<br/>- Instead of ever saying “You’re wrong”, say “I think that’s wrong”<br/>- Criticize in private but praise in public<br/>- Not every superstar engineer wants to manage.<br/><br/>* Emotional labour is part of the job<br/><br/>One of the anecdotes that really stuck in my head was when Kim explained how she had to do an urgent pricing model analysis. She cleared her calendar, stormed into the office, and headed straight to her desk to get the job done. As she walked through the hallway, she was forced to undergo a rollercoaster of emotions and conversations. I don’t remember the exact details, but some people had positive stories to share about their children’s sports teams or plays, some other individuals were going through serious health problems and needed to take some time of, someone else just wanted to talk. While managers are not baby-sitters, the emotional labour is part of the job.<br/><br/>*  It’s all about balance<br/><br/>The author went on in great detail about there is always a problem at big companies. Things are either moving too fast or moving too slow. There is either too much planning or not enough. This sounds obvious when written so plainly, but it was a strong way for the author to become relatable so early in the book.<br/><br/>* Diamonds in Russia<br/><br/>After graduating with a degree in Russian literature, Kim Scott got a job working with diamond cutters in July of 1992. She tried to motivate her team by offering American salaries, but all they really cared about is that she teach them english and give a damn about their future.<br/><br/>*  Challenging others & Feedback<br/><br/>Providing candid feedback is not radical if you nitpick or don’t care personally. You need to challenge people and explain what they did wrong, but actually care about them as well. As a rule of thumb, the author said that three unimportant things should be left unsaid each day. She also quote Collen Powell in saying that if people are not mad, they’re not being challenged enough. <br/><br/>When doing yearly reviews, Kim said that instead of asking what a person’s potential is, the right question to ask is what growth trajectory the individual seeks. Also, rather than labelling someone as a “high performer” or a “low performer”, it’s best to to label people’s achievements as a solid quarter, off quarter, exceptional quarter, etc…<br/><br/>It is hard to judge someone based on a one hour interview, but everyone can shine somewhere. This may imply working for a different company, a different team, or simply taking on a different role. However, if a person does not seem to have found their “mojo” at a certain company after two years, it is likely that they never will.<br/><br/>*  Sherryl Sendberg<br/><br/>After a few very successful presentations at Google, Sheryl Sandburg did not let the positives outweigh the negatives. She provided Kim with radical feedback by telling her that she sounded stupid for saying um a lot and suggested a speach coach. This turned out to have an immense impact on Kim’s speaking and presentation abilities.<br/><br/>* Tokyo Interaction<br/><br/>While working with part of the team in Tokyo, Kim noticed that the Japanese are very hesitant to confront their superiors. They never critiqued the process or raised red flags. Kim told the team about how Toyota factories have a red box: every new employee must stand in the red box in the middle of the factory at the end of their first week until they find points on which to critique the whole manufarutinrg process. After bringing up that she considered adding a red box of her own at Google, one person raised a complain about the tea. While this is no impactful, Kim made sure the tea was changed at once, and it led to other changes and improvements over time.<br/><br/>* Google<br/>Larry page once wasted a summer at an internship and vowed that it won't happen to anyone else. <br/><br/>The Google product team had a rule to not allow product managers with a computer science degree. Twitter and instagram cofounders ended up leaving the company for this exact reason before starting their own companies. <br/><br/>There was a point in time when Sergei Brin yelled out ""if this was a normal company, you would do what I said"". This happened when the awards team thought his idea/approach was wrong, but he still really just wanted two people to try to implement his idea. Ultimately no one went with his approach, and it was the correct decision. The fact that Google was able to build and maintain a culture like this is extremely impressive.<br/><br/>Managers cannot block engineers at Google from switching teams. Author chose to hire a transfer who had very bad reviews. It turned out well!<br/><br/>Someone who excels at Google by constantly iterating may not necessarily succeed at Apple where the product has to be perfect before it ships.",,,1,0

Price,"Price, David A.",,"=""0307265757""","=""9780307265753""",4,3.95,Knopf,Hardcover,304,2008,2008,2019/05/10,2015/03/07,,,read,"After reading Creativity Inc a few years ago, I have not been able to get it out of my mind and would classify it as one of all-time favorite all-time books. Having grown up watching Disney movies during one of their golden periods (between the late 80s and the late 90s), the introduction to Ed Catmull’s autobiography really resonated with me. As a Pixar film enthusiast, I fell in love with Pixar’s origin story and the process they follow to create new films. I’ve been wanting to read another book on Pixar for a while, but having been putting it off so I could get more joy out of it. The time has finally come about a month ago :)<br/><br/>The Pixar Touch is a fantastic complement to Creativity Inc. The book isn’t quite as emotional, and doesn’t delve into the details of braintrust or how Pixar operates. However, The Pixar Touch gives a much more distant history of how Pixar came to be, a much broader view of how the company grew, a better understanding of its finances, and introduced a lot more key individuals that led to Pixar’s success.<br/><br/>I’m repeatedly impressed by how persistent Ed Catmull had to be for decades while trying to achieve his dream of making a 3D animated feature film. There were a lot of ups and downs, a lot of scrutiny, politics, business issues, backstabbing, but he was persistent on reaching hi goal. I would guess that a lot of people would’ve given up much earlier, as they faced financial, political or technical issues. While I can’t tell for sure, I also got the impression that he remained positive and respectful throughout the whole experience.<br/><br/>One of the major shifts I noticed while reading this book and comparing it to modern day technology is the FOMO or bubble that we live in today. Everyone wanted to invest in internet stocks during the dot com bubble. Everyone is trying to invest in the next large FANG or growth company today. However, Pixar was an extremely underrated and undervalued technology for decades! It had so much promise and potential, but could barely several for single digit millions. Today, a simple white paper can sell for several times that!<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts of reading this book was putting together this review after the fact. Reading the book about the history of an animation company does not do it justice. I went back and watched all the short films while writing up this review. It really shoes that Toy Story was not a zero-to-one achievement. It took Catmull, Lasseter and the rest of the team a very long time to master all the necessary. From render complex objects, to achieve fluid animations, and most importantly, putting together a captivating storyline.<br/><br/>=== Events that stood out ===<br/><br/>The Very Beginning<br/>The founder of the New York Institute of Technology, Alexander Schure, was the OG angel investor that got Pixar off the ground in the 1970s.  He started a Computer Graphics Lab and just poured in as money as Ed and his team needed. He bought the team a total of 6 frame buffers, which were $80,000 a piece at the time without hesitation. Each element in the frame buffer could store 8 bytes, so the team ultimately put 3 of them together in order to represent the first RGB (3-8 byte values) encoded pixel. At Schure’s lab, the team also invented the Z-Buffer, antialiasing and tweening for 2D animation. There was a lot of great foundational work done at this lab, but it was way ahead of its time.<br/><br/>While Schure did seem to have “unlimited” funds, he did ask the team to try and make profit at some point. They get rejected by Chevrolet, cola and Disney as they tried to make commercials… Computer graphics animation was obviously too early.<br/><br/>* Lucas Film<br/><br/>The special effects in the first Star Wars film were done using entirely analog visual effects.  Lucas Film tried to hire a team of Computer Graphics engineers to advance this approach. ILM ended up reaching out to Ed, who moved over, and slowly took the rest of his team at NYIT with him. Personally, it feels as though they did a disservice to Shure, who was fair and provided great opportunities. However, the team was looking out for themselves and were simply accepting the best opportunities available to them.<br/><br/>Hiring became a lot easier for Ed after having moved to ILM. Everyone, including University professors, Being architects, and others jumped at the opportunity to be part of the Star Wars franchise.<br/><br/>Lucas was averse to integrate the work of the CG Lab into his films, but ultimately came around for one of the Lava Scenes in the second film. The scene turned out to be a great success. While trying to get ILM to integrate their work in the Star Wars films, Ed’s team also did special effects in Star Trek, Power Rangers, and several other live action films.<br/><br/>* Long-term Vision<br/>Ed Catmull had always wanted to create a 3D animated feature film, but knew it was way too early in the 70s and 80s. He also knew that the film did not need to be photo realistic, but simply captivating enough to capture the viewer’s attention. For example, the original hand drawn Disney movies had a staccato feel due to the lack of motion bloor, but it did not detract from the story.<br/><br/>Towards the late 80s, Ed hired John Lasseter. Lasseter, a brilliant animator who shared in Catmull’s vision, was going to play a key role in Pixar’s success after being let go from Disney due to a project that got shelved.<br/><br/>* The Adventures of Andre & Wally B<br/>One of the first few shorts that Catmull and Lasseter (along with their team) presented at Siggraph was ""The Adventures of Andre & Wally B”. The technical feat was impressive, but the story lacked depth, a lot of people did not see its potential, and Disney animators though that computer animation will never be able to capture the “nuances” of animated character.<br/><br/>*  Steve Jobs<br/>Lucasfilm did not get as much value out of its Computer Graphics Lab as originally anticipated, so it was put up for sale. At the low price of $5MM, no no one wanted to budge for over a year.<br/><br/>Ed Catmull and his team (total of 40), his team built new rendering techniques, innovative hardware, new software and came with both a creative and technical team. This was a steal given that the selling price was between $5M and $15MM. Lucasfilm obviously did not appreciate what they had… The automative industry was also at the forefront of graphics rendering at the time, but never invested too much money in it…<br/><br/>One of the things I loved about this book is that I learnt even more about Steve Jobs:<br/>- His birth mom was a grad student who wouldn't give him away unless the adopting parents promised to send him to College<br/>- During his infamous India trip, he somehow convinced Atari to pay for his flight to Germany so his trip would be cheaper<br/>- While Steve Jobs was in higschool, he sent a letter to the CEO of HP asking for some spare parts for a side project. He ultimately managed to get a summer job at HP’s assembly line.<br/><br/>About a year after Steve’s first offer, shortly after he left Apple, Catmull and his team agreed to be bought out for a mere $5MM. Over the years, Steve would pour a total of $50MM to finance the company and keep it afloat. Most interestingly, Steve believed that the hardware Pixar was selling for Graphics Rendering was going to be the company’s core business. With the rise of computer industry, he was looking to recreate what he achieved at Apple, and what he lacked to achieve at NEXT. Steve was never interested in making software or movies, he only wanted to make computers. However, Ed and Lasseter found a way to work with him while keeping their own vision in mind.<br/><br/>A few years after working as a standalone company, and continuously pumping more and more money to keep the company afloat, Steve Jobs managed to screw everyone over by essentially nullifying everyone’s stock options. I did not completely understand the details of the story, but because he essentially owned the whole company, he retroactively took away everyone’s stock options at no price. He achieved this by created a new company in an effort to try and get back some of the money he invested in the company.<br/><br/>Up until Toy Story’s success, Steve Jobs, like ILM, also started trying to sell the company elsewhere… However, with the success of Toy Story, he immediately took the company public, got rich, and gained fame for a second success. After Pixar IPOed, only a few people (Steve, Catmull, Lasseter and the new CFO) got rich - the rest of the company got almost nothing. Even Catmull’s share amounted to a mere 4% of the company.<br/><br/>* Late 80s achievements <br/><br/>Around this time, Pixar tried to build out the renderscript standard which didn’t really catch on. However, their proprietary software, Renderman, which is based on render script had great success and is still being used today.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, part of the team at Pixar, led by by John Lasseter produced Red’s dream in 1987. It was a short 4 minute film about a unicycle with great dreams. It showcased many geometric primitives all in one scene, which was accepted with a lot of enthusiasm at SIGGRAPH, but never won any awards, nor was the work continued.<br/><br/>The difference between Wally B and Red’s dream made me realize how important story telling is, in addition to the vast improvement in their graphics software.<br/><br/>A year later, the same team led by John Lasseter released Tin Toy. This was a 5 minute film which was Pixar’s first Oscar for best animated short film. It was also the first CGI film to win an Oscar. The most impressive feat is that this film feature a human baby. Ironically, not only did the baby’s diaper look like concrete, but the baby himself looked like an old man. This was a huge stepping stone in preparing Pixar for what’s to come.<br/><br/><br/>* Politics, Lawsuits, and a lot more…<br/><br/>I had no idea how many troubles Pixar had to go through even after it IPOed..<br/><br/>Around the same time that Bug’s Life came out, Dreamworks came out with Antz. There were a lot of politics regarding to timing, plot stealing, release timing, etc…<br/><br/>After Monster’s Inc came out, there was a huge lawsuit related to the fact that a musical menuscript had a similar premise related to monsters who are afraid of humans. A lawsuit ensued…<br/><br/>Turns out that the President of Disney was killed in 1994. This resulted in, you guessed it, more politics because certain people did not get the promotions or bonuses that they were promised. https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-04-mn-42417-story.html",,,1,0
39328092,AIQ: How People and Machines Are Smarter Together,Nick Polson,"Polson, Nick",James Scott,"=""""","=""""",5,4.16,St. Martin's Press,Kindle Edition,261,2018,,2019/06/22,2018/10/07,,,read,"AIQ Review<br/><br/>A short and educational read explaining how Artificial Intelligence is nothing more than statistics with a ton of data on steroids. The book does a great job at raising the curtains that make AI seem so magical and mysterious. It also grounds all the misconceptions and hype around a Skynet type general AI. Computers are much better than humans at remembering things, processing large amounts of data, and doing repetitive tasks very quickly. Similarly, a hammer is much better than humans at hitting things without being hurt or damaged. Both of these are tools that benefit humans, and the fear of being taken over by the tools we built is overhyped science fiction.<br/><br/>As a software engineer, who works closely with machine learning scientists, and has gone through Andrew Ng’s Coursera ML course, I still got a ton of value out of this book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to freshen up on their stats knowledge, or expand their knowledge of history. In particular, the book does a great job at correlating modern advancements and uses of ML/AI to scientific developments of the past 100 years.<br/><br/>One of the things I hadn’t realized is that the big data, machines learning and cloud computing boom started around 2010. I was already in college and literally saw this revolution happen before my eyes!<br/><br/>Over the past few decades, engineers/scientists in this field really made a lot of mathematical and scientific breakthroughs. However, after reading this book, my previous assumption were validated. Almost nobody does  “real machine learning” nowadays. Since various frameworks (pytorch, tensorflow, keras, caffe, etc…) have commoditized the ability to build and train neural networks, feature extraction has become the most difficult part of machine learning. The process of data collection, data cleansing, data analysis, data pipeline, and deciding how to represent that data is all machine learning has really come to. Everything else is just trial and error along with throwing a ton of data (i.e. steroids) at the problem. The book does a great job at exemplifying this by referring to two letters: Big N (big number of independent data points) and Big D (a lot of detail in every data point).<br/><br/>""It may seem like we rely on depend smart machines for everything these days, but in reality, they depend on us a lot more.""<br/><br/>==== Some cool facts from the book that stood out ====<br/><br/>Moore’s Law<br/>One of the AI/ML advancement enablers in the past decade is Moore’s Law. However, it’s not just Moore’s Law in the context of processors, but also in the context of data quantity and the availability cloud compute. All of this, along with many other enables, all played a key role in AI’s hyper growth.<br/><br/>UBI<br/>A common concern amongst many who are afraid of AI is the number of jobs (i.e. truck driving) it’ll make disappear. As a big Andrew Yang fan myself, and a big proponent of Universal Basic Income, I really connected with the authors’ similar viewpoin. I do not want technological advancement to be hindered by a fear of job loss, but am aware that it could lead to an increase in unemployment. For example, truck driving, which is the most popular job in the will most certainly be impact by the ubiquity of autonomous vehicles. I believe that as long as we put UBI policies in place, and provide the infrastructure for individuals to be retrained in a different career path, if they choose to, we can move forward without looking back.<br/><br/>Netflix<br/>In 2007, Netflix offered $1MM to anyone who could beat their recommendation algorithm by more than 10%. A lot of teams came really close, but it took 2 years for a team to beat Netflix’s recommendation algorithm by 0.06%. Ironically, another team also managed to submit a winning solution exactly 19 minutes after the first.<br/><br/>House of Cards was the first Netflix original, and as we all know, a great success. The reason this is the case is because Netflix had gathered a lot of data on what kind of shows that appeal to the general public, and therefore knew it was going to be a success.<br/><br/>The authors discuss how traditional television networks waste hundreds of millions to pilot many different shows to see what sticks. Netflix’s data allows them to create successful shows with a very low probability of failure.<br/><br/>World War 2<br/>Abraham Wald played a key role in mathematic and statistical developments during WWII. <br/><br/>The planes that were returning from battle had a lot of holes in the fuselage, so the generals thought of adding more armor to that section of the plane. However, Abraham correctly identified that we should make note of the planes that do not return, which were likely shot in the engine, and that is where more armor should be added.<br/><br/>The key point of comparison between the bombers returning and Netflix’s recommendation system is that both of these systems use conditional probability with large data sets and latent features. Abraham Wald didn’t know where the non-returning planes were getting hit, and Netflix doesn’t know viewer’s opinions on most movies because most users do not watch most movies.<br/> <br/>After WWII, the US spent $17B in the early 60s to install microphones across the whole Atlantic. How cool is that!<br/><br/>Asia - Toilet Paper Theft<br/>Individuals in Japan and China used to steal toilet paper from public spaces. Authorities tried to limit the toilet paper “per visit” to 6 sheets. While this slowed things down, the thieves were just walking around and returning to the same booths periodically. The final solution was to use facial recognition and only dispense toilet paper per person every X hours.<br/><br/>Physicists<br/>Hubble used the pulsating star theory, and collected a lot of data, to prove that Andromeda was located in a different Galaxy, thereby disproving the “single Galaxy theory”.<br/><br/>Elina Berglund, who helped discover the Higgs boson, decided to use big data to kill the birth control pill. A smartphone app, along with input from the user concerning body temperature and menstrual cycle became highly accurate at determining when a woman is ovulating.<br/><br/>Moravec's paradox<br/><br/>From wikipedia: “It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility”<br/><br/>Bayes' theorem<br/>At the basis of all probability analyses is Baye’s theorem, which is actually quite straight forward:  the probability that an event A occurs given that another event B has already occurred is equal to the probability that the event B occurs given that A has already occurred multiplied by the probability of occurrence of event A and divided by the probability of occurrence of event B.<br/><br/>SLAM<br/>At the time of writing the book, GPS is only accurate up to 5m. This is good for most uses cases but not for autonomous vehicles, drones, etc… This is where SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) prevails. It does introspection by collecting data from various censors (color, grayscale, IMUs, depth, etc..) and exterminates (i.e. predicts) the device’s location/pose.<br/><br/>Grace Hopper<br/>I had always heard of the Grace Hopper conference for women, but never realized how influential she was in the world of computer science.<br/><br/>Hopper grew up in a military family and managed to become one of the first female naval officers.<br/><br/>She wars the first American computer expert after she was assigned to work on the Mark I at Harvard. After that, she started working on the UNIVAC, which was the first large scale electronic computer adopted by various corporations such as ADP or Dupont for database operations.<br/><br/>She was a pioneer in NLP, computer compilers, and played a key role in making sure that the American government adapt to using modern computer systems.<br/><br/>Coin Clipping<br/><br/>The book went into great depth about coin clipping in the 16th century. Due to the variability in coin weight, it was easy to clip “excess” coin on heavy coins and make a little bit of extra money. It took a while for Isaac Newton to develop the method of least squares, which was followed by the great recoinage, to avoid this sort of theft in the future.<br/><br/>Cool Applications of AI<br/>- There is a smart knife that tells the surgeons whether they’re cutting/burning healthy or cancerous tissues. This is done by sending the burning smoke to a mass spectrometer, analyzing the data and feeding it into a prediction rule This takes 3 seconds and has a 100% accuracy rate.<br/>- Ali baba ships products to nearby warhorses before items are purchased to guarantee faster delivery, since they can predict which products are going to be bought when and where!<br/><br/>Florence Nightingale<br/>Florence nightingale was a nurse and data scientist. In the 1800s, she was driven by both maths and helping people. She used her skills and interests to built an efficient data driven hospitals/camps to help as many injured soldiers as possible. She was the first woman elected to the UK data analytics organization, and was truly a remarkable and influential individual.<br/><br/>Compounding<br/>If something has a 0.9 chance of happening, the compounding rule states that the chance of it happen 10 times is 0.9^10. However, the compunding rule does not apply to population averages where there are a lot of lurking variables that need to be taken into consideration, and often leads to conclusion bias.<br/><br/>For example, if 90% of the population has a tails only coin, then 90% of all flips will always result in tails. However, the compounding rule will apply ONLY IF all the coins are fair.",,,1,0

23692271,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"Harari, Yuval Noah",,"=""""","=""""",4,4.37,Vintage,Paperback,512,2015,2011,,2017/05/22,,,read,"================== First Attempt ==================<br/><br/>Discretion: I only made my way through the first 5 chapters of this book.<br/><br/>As a recent best seller that covers a topic that everyone is peculiar about at some point and even made it to the Gates Notes, I was really looking forward to reading this book.<br/><br/>While it starts out strong and invigorating, it quickly divulges into a series of factoids that are difficult to comprehend. The story of humankind is complicated and non-linear. There were a lot of names, dates and controversies that were jumbled in my head. I found that there was very little knowledge I was retaining, and given how many books I want to read, this one simply wasn't worth the time investment...<br/><br/>Maybe I'll pick this up again at some point the future, but probably not.<br/><br/><br/>================== Second Attempt ==================<br/><br/>I first tried to read this book about a year ago and stopped about 20% through since it felt like a constant stream of facts that I couldn’t retain. My second attempt at listening to it, after having reading Homo Deus, was significantly better. Though I like the ideas presented in Homo Deus much more, this book sets the context and acts as a prequel that provides all the necessary background to understand how humanity got to where we are.<br/><br/>As a much more controversial and opinionated piece, Homo Deus appeals to me much more. This book simply covers the evolution of human behaviors and interactions since the day that we were apes, through to where we are today. There is no debate or argument. It is a simple sequential presentation of interesting facts. Anyone reading this will definitely encounter a lot of repeated knowledge because it covers everything from religion, to science, economics, politics and history. However, I’m also sure that there are at least a few tidbits that anyone can take away.<br/><br/><br/>=== Cool notes/facts I took away from the book === <br/><br/>Animal facts<br/>- All felines shared an ancestors 25,000 years go<br/>- Mules are the result of horses and donkeys interbreeding, and are always infertile<br/>- Saber tooth tiger, camels, sloths and a plethora of other animals were native to America before humans inhabited it<br/><br/>Ancient human facts<br/>- Human braise use 35% of our resting energy, whereas ape brains only use 8% <br/>- The reason humans are born “prematurely” by animal standards and require care for many years after birth is due to the fact that we’re upright. Being upright causes our hips to narrow, so a child must be born before they’re fully “developed”.<br/>- Scientists didn’t know whether Sapiens killed or merged with Neanderthals until 2010. Until in 2010, after a neanderthal DNA was sequence, did we discover that the average human shares 1%-4% of their DNA with them. This put the longstanding debate to a halt.<br/><br/>Human nature<br/>- Gossip: By nature, humans love to gossip. Yuval brought up the fact that there are plenty of magazines and websites like buzzfeed that only discuss gossip. However, even the most educated and eloquent amongst us spend a lot of time gossiping. For example, while scientists may discuss their work and experiments over lunch, sooner or later the conversation will devolve to discussing other people in their facility.<br/>- Dunbars number: The largest group of people where everyone can know everyone else without needing a complex hierarchy is 150. This means that once a startup exceeds 150 people, it becomes very difficult for everyone to know what everyone else is working on.<br/>- The reason humans are sad is because they always crave for more and are not fulfilled with what they have. This point is further discussed in the “Luxury Trap” section below.<br/>- Cognitive dissonance: One of the differentiating features between humans and apes is cognitive dissonance. This means we’re able to maintain contradicting values in our heads at once. This has lead many anthropologists to state that the best way to study human culture is by evaluating the catch 22s in their society (religion, state, organization, etc…), rather than studying the prestige values that they follow. For example, Jews are not allowed to use electricity on Saturdays but still find ways to eat warm meals ;)<br/><br/>Human society<br/>- State and companies: Yuval had a relatively long and interesting discussion comparing state and companies to religions. They’re all equally made up, with their own set of rules, being enforced by some party or set of individuals, adhered by some set of people, and rejected or questioned by others. This really made me question a few of my own beliefs….<br/>- Luxuries:<br/>    - Any piece of luxury a human receives eventually turns into a necessity. The telephone, internet washing machines, dishwaters, etc, were all luxuries at some point in the past.<br/>    - Yuval discussed how a lot of people have a dream of getting their dream job around 35, but first choose to accept a typical mainstream job to get the experience and earn the living they need to support themselves at 35. However, once they reach that age, there are kids, a mortgage, a higher standard of living they’ve grown accustomed to, an expectation of being able to afford a vacation a few times a year, etc… Having a car is a luxury when you’re 20, but becomes a necessary that most can’t give up when they’re 35. This is a trap a lot of people fall into, and once I’m afraid I might fall into myself unless I make changes in the near future.<br/>    - The agricultural and industrial revolutions were agricultural traps in themselves.<br/>- Forbidden vs enabled: Human society (i.e. culture) decides what is forbidden and was is not, while human biology determines what can be enabled and what cannot. Homosexual intercourse is a prime example of this.<br/>- There was a pretty extensive explanation of how everything in our world is driven by consumerism. The things we want, the things we do, the things we aspire for. It’s extremely sad, but is extremely true if you think about it. One of the things that really bothers me is the addiction to traveling nowadays. Everyone thinks that travel will “change my mindset and open my eyes”, while in reality, that is simply what consumerism forces us to believe. It is romanticized beyond belief, while in reality, people just need a change of mindset every once in a while.<br/><br/>Human History<br/>- Yuval drew a comparison between the set of rules that king Hammurabi set for the Babylonians and the American declaration of independence. It makes sense that these two sets of rules are similar in very ways, but they diverged when Yuval pointed out that Americans are all treated equally, whereas the Babylonians had different rules depending on the class the individual belonged to. For example, if a man cut another man’s arm off, there was a fee one had to pay depending on the class of the victim.<br/>- The numbers we know today (0-9) are known as the “Arab numerals”, but were actually developed by the hindus <br/>- Homosexuality was very common and accepted in Ancient Greece<br/>- Rape was very much accepted in the olden days. If a man were to rape a young girl, all he had to do was pay her father a certain amount depending on the victim’s class. Furthermore, rape is still okay in the majority of the cultures in the world today.<br/>- It is fair to say that human’s primary goal is to reproduce - it’s in our nature. Thousands of years of evolution have lead to females becoming submissive caretakers and men become aggressive “bring home the bacon” protectors. This is a relatively outdated sexist view, but it is a basic result of evolution.<br/><br/>Religious/Political history<br/>- Communism: The goal of communism was that “everyone works according to their abilities and receives according to their needs”, but the result of communism turned out to be that “everyone works as little as they can get away with and receive as much as they can grab""<br/>- Modern day synagogue<br/>    - Jews like to believe that their culture has remained pristine over thousands of years, but it is nothing today like it was before<br/>    - Yiddish is a German dialogue, whereas Hebrew was the actual language spoken back in the day<br/>    - Modern day jews discuss and dispute the meaning of Talmud (Babylonian scrolls), whereas they did not exist in the early days of Judaism<br/>    - If King David were to walk into a modern day synagogue, he’d be confused by what modern day Orthodox are wearing.<br/>- Global Empire: The world is governed by three primary pillars: money, government and religion. Everything is just a derivative of these three things.<br/>- Local monotheism: A non-forcing (no missionaries) religion with a single god.<br/>- Global monotheism: A forcing (many missionaries) religion with a single god.<br/>- In the olden days, religion was non forcing. Global religion, however, though with many downsides, the cause of many wars, many deaths and the dark ages, was key in uniting the whole world together.<br/>- Zoroastrianism: one of the world's oldest religions that remains active. It is a monotheistic faith, centered in a dualistic cosmology of good and evil and an eschatology predicting the ultimate destruction of evil.<br/>- Buddhism: Life is all about reality without necessarily accepting, craving or challenging it. For example, if something in life went south, we should definitely try to fix it, but we should not fixate on the negativity that resolves around it.<br/>    - Nirvana:  transcendent state in which there is neither suffering, desire, nor sense of self, and the subject is released from the effects of karma and the cycle of death and rebirth. It represents the final goal of Buddhism. It also literally translates to “extinguishing the fire”, which makes me think of the “this is fine” meme and how Nirvana can be achieved if I can extinguish (or accept) the fire around me.<br/>- Politics and political ideologies are extremely similar with a few subtle differences.  Islam has an omnipotent God. Karl Marx was the “father” of Communism. Buddhism doesn't have a God. In all other ways, these ideologies are extremely similar. <br/><br/>Economic History<br/>- Those who know history best have the hardest time explaining why a decision or event was reached. This is due to the fact that they know of all the alternatives. “How” is easy but ‘why” is hard.<br/>- There was a long section written about the scientific revolution. There was nothing new for me there, but it was beautiful and touched really close to heart. In fact, it really made me appreciate the times we live in today.<br/>- The very first insurance fund ever created was designed by a group of ministers from court who wanted a way for widows to live comfortably in the case that their husbands pass away. What started as an honest effort turned into one of the largest industries in the world today.<br/>- Yuval spent some time discussing the importance of credit and the concept of reserve ratios in banks. It is interesting but there was nothing new for me here.<br/><br/>Recent History<br/>- Healthcare and human survivability has really increased in recent past. The mother of King Edward the 2nd had 16 kids, only 3 of whom lived past 40.<br/>- Scurvy was a very common cause of death for sailors. James cook managed to save most of them by empirically finding out that simply eating more vitamin C (from dried fruits) saved their lives.<br/>- Neil Armstrong once met with a native tribe prior to his mission on the moon. When he told the tribe of what he’s embarking on, they taught him a phrase  in their native language and had him memorize it. The natives asked him to repeat it once he got to the moon. Before going on his mission, he asked a translator what the phrase meant, and it was: “Don't believe a word these people say, they've come to steal your land”….<br/>- Adam Smith, who is known as the father of Modern Economics, famously wrote “The Wealth of Nations” in the 1700s. In it he stated that rich people are the ones responsible for driving the economy. Some people refer to it as the “capitalism manifesto”.<br/>- Before the modern days of tech startups, sailing and discovery was a form of ancient startups. Columbus famously spent years for someone to fund his voyage. Once he got sufficient funding, he conquered America and made many people very rich through the discovery of new gold and silver mines. When this happened, a lot of other sailors and investors tried to repeat the success Columbus had achieved. Unfortunately, most voyages ended in no results or death, causing investors (like VCs) to lose their entire investment.<br/>- The Mississippi bubble: In the 1800s, during the founding of New Orleans, the Paris exchange started selling equity in the new state being developed. Each share reached an astonishing price of 10,000 leveret before crashing all the way back down to zero.<br/>- French Revolution: Louis the 16th realized at one point that the country had taken on so much debt, that half of the country’s annual budget went solely towards paying off their interest payments in the 1780s. This was obviously not sustainable for long and was ultimately one of the catalysts for the French Revolution.<br/>- Gun powder: While the Chinese managed to discover gun powder in the 9th century for fire crackers, it took almost 600 years for Western Europe to adapt that technology to guns.<br/>- Modern World Wars: There are many reasons why there haven’t been any world wars in the past 70 years. One of the main reasons brought up by Yuval is that it is not economic. Ever since atomic bombs were discovered, the price of war soared, but the profits declined. In the worst gave, we spent billions of dollars and annihilate each other. In the best case, we can take over another country’s land and agriculture. However, unlike in olden times, the global economy is setup for it to be more lucrative for each nation to simply operate in peaceful trade rather than distressful war.<br/><br/>Biological innovations<br/>- Project Gilgamesh: Project Gilgamesh, formally established on 3rd May 2014, is an initiative devoted to educating the public about radical life extension and cryonics as scientific possibilities and moral imperatives. Before the blog, Project Gilgamesh took the form of face-to-face presentations delivered among a cadre of friends and to anyone with interest in an introduction to life extension and/or cryonics.<br/>- Genetic engineering: There were a lot of cool genetic engineering experiments Yuval referenced in the book.<br/>    - A rabbit was injected with jellyfish genes such that it glowed in the night<br/>    - The genes of a human ear were injected on the back of a mouse such that it grew a new year. This can be very useful for “body regeneration”<br/>    - E coli was used to produce cheap insulin<br/>    - The genes of an arctic fish were injected into potatoes so they are more first resistant<br/>    - Pigs were injected with fish genes such that they produce healthy omega 3 fats instead of unhealthy omega 6 fats<br/>    - Cows were genetallicaly engineered such that they don’t get sick<br/>- There have been many studies and a lot of evidence that things don’t make us happy, but hormones do. This is why placebo works, and why money does not necessarily lead to happiness. There have been thought experiments studies simulated do the following:<br/>    - Ask 2 people what their level of happiness is<br/>    - One person wins the lottery and another person gets into a car crash (that does not injure their health) on the same day<br/>    - Two years later, it is very likely that both of them will have the same level of happiness <br/><br/>",,,1,0
35604796,What Is Real?: The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics,Adam  Becker,"Becker, Adam",,"=""0465096050""","=""9780465096053""",5,4.27,Basic Books,Hardcover,384,2018,2018,2019/02/03,2018/12/31,,,read,"A phenomenally well written, educational, captivating, easy to understand book about the science, history and politics of Quantum Physics.<br/><br/>This book requires no prior knowledge of anything related to physics. One could pick up this book not knowing who Einstein was, and gain a ton of value. One could also pick up this book after having to solve many problem sets involving Schrodinger Equations,  and still gain a ton of value. The only audience who might not find this book interesting are those who study physics for a living and are most likely familiar with most of its contents.<br/><br/>I had always envisioned the physics community getting together for afternoon tea and sharing ideas in a welcome, collaborative and respective manner. Having read this book and watched the first season of the show Genius (covering Einstein’s life), I realized that it’s no more elegant than the geopolitical tensions occurring in the world today. There is a ton of haste, disloyalty, distrust, group-think and siding of opinion. My glorified perception of physicists was “let’s work together to reveal the secrets of the universe” turned into “your theory is shit and I’ll make sure you never get a job if you try to challenge my ideas again.”<br/><br/>The first half of the book maintains really good chronological order as the all of the big names (Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Neumann, etc…) are discussed and the foundations of Quantum Mechanics are introduced. However, the only names that really stood out from the second half of the book are David Bohm, John Steward Bell and Hugh Everret. It was difficult to discern the timeline between the late 1960s through the early 2000s, and a lot of tangential names were interspersed throughout the late 20th century. There were a lot of details which were difficult to follow, but the big picture was still very coherent.<br/><br/>As an undergraduate Engineering Science student at UofT, I had to take many math and physics courses. Some of these physics courses include:<br/>- Classical Mechanics<br/>- Fluid Mechanics<br/>- Thermodynamics<br/>- Waves & Modern Physics<br/>- Molecules & Materials<br/>- Quantum & Thermal Physics<br/>- Semiconductors and electrical devices<br/>There was a point when I was solving problems involving Schrodinger’s equation on a daily basis. However, I always accepted the Copenhagen interpretation as Gospel and it never crossed my mind to question it. None of my professors ever mentioned the EPR paper or any of at the alternative Quantum Mechanics interpretations. I presume that these would’ve come up if I had continued my studies in physics, but it still feels as if I was lied to. In addition, I felt that school was too saturated by numbers and equations, missing the beauty of the bigger picture and philosophy of Quantum Mechanics. This book has made me realize how important it is to study the history of science in addition to the science itself.<br/><br/>==================<br/><br/>Below are some of the interesting points that stood out to me.<br/><br/>Schrödinger’s cat<br/>---<br/>I’ve heard and discussed the Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment many times. However, I never knew that the superposition of the cat’s liveness was dependent on whether or not a radioactive atom were to decay, which would trigger a vile of poison to break.<br/><br/>Niels Bohr<br/>---<br/>I recall studying Bohr diagrams in my high school chemistry and physics classes, but was never aware of his involvement in Quantum Physics. For all intents and purposes, Bohr is the grandfather of Quantum Physics. Given that he passed away in the 1960s, it’s amazing to consider how nascent this field is.<br/><br/>According to various people who worked with Bohr, he was supposedly a very poor writer, a very slow thinker and extremely bad at articulating his thoughts. When attending action films with his colleagues, he often had to ask what was going on because he couldn’t keep up with the pace of the film. I’m sure he would’ve failed today’s entrance exams into any University…<br/><br/>John von Neumman<br/>---<br/>I had always known that he was a key figure in the physics world, but was not aware of his child prodigy status. He taught himself calculus by the age of 8, knew at least 7 languages, acquired his first PhD by the age of 19, and that was just the beginning…<br/><br/>The book mentioned that some people referred to him as a Marian because of how extraordinary he was.<br/><br/>Copenhagen Interoperation<br/>---<br/>Bohr and Heisenberg came up with a lot of the foundational ideas of Quantum Mechanics in Copenhagen during the 1920s. They derived a wave function which describes the probabilistic nature of a wave-particle. Hesinberg’s uncertainty principle further added that if a particle-wave’s location is measured, it’s meaningless to speak of its momentum and vice versa. Most importantly, this was the first time the measurement paradox was introduced, whereby a measurement causes the wave function to collapse, which begs the question of what is allowed to make a measurement ? A human? A cat? A machine? An ant?<br/><br/>Max Borne, Neumman and several other physicists helped support and formalize the Copenhagen interoperation, but it was very loosely defined between the 1920s and 1950s until Heisenberg published his book.<br/><br/>A fun fact about Heisenberg is that he was the youngest tenured professor at the time. He was afraid Schrödinger was going to outpace because of how neck in neck both of them were.<br/><br/>Albert Einstein<br/>---<br/>The more I learn about Einstein, the more amazed I am by his character. In addition to his contributions to relativity and Quantum Mechanics, he also wrote about Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, and much more. This is simply Amazing! Einstein discovered the existence of photons 20 years before anyone else believe him.<br/><br/>EPR paper<br/>---<br/>I did not delve into the full details of the EPR paper yet, but in 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen showed that “spooky action at a distance” (now known as Quantum Entanglement) proved that the Copenhagen Interoperation is incomplete.<br/><br/>Solvay conference<br/>---<br/>The Solvay conference is one of the most popular physics conferences that are held every few years. During the 5th Solvay conference in 1927, 17 out of the 29 attendees went on or either already have won a Novel prize! What a gathering of brilliant minds…<br/><br/>World war 2<br/>---<br/>The war brought a harsh stop to the theoretical and philosophical discussions surrounding Quantum Physics. Instead, money and effort translated into more practical applications of Quantum Physics. Oppenheimer led the Manhattan project in the US. Heisenberg and his colleagues said they were researching a nuclear reactor in Germany, though in reality most of the effort was going into nuclear bomb research.<br/><br/>The pentagon was built, which was the largest building in the world at the time. There was such a large influx of cash into the ecosystem that the number of students attending postgraduate studies in physics skyrocketed.<br/><br/>David Bohm<br/>---<br/>Bohm had various contributions to physics and math, but his most famous contribution is the pilot-wave theory, also known as Bohemian Mechanics. This was the first example of the hidden variable theory. By introducing non locality, his theory solves the problems of wave-particle duality, wave function collapse and Schrodingers cat. In this theory, each particle “lives” on a pilot wave, which introduces deterministic behavior to Quantum Mechanics. I haven’t had time to delve into the details of how this really works…<br/><br/>Unfortunately, most of Bohm’s work was rejected throughout his life. He challenges the status quo, and paid the price… Due to his marxist involvements, he was exiled on several occasions. He lived in America, Brazil and Britain at various points through his life. This made it difficult from him to present and spread his work, which had already been shut down by most of the Copenhagen Interpretation supporters. <br/><br/>John Stewart Bell<br/>---<br/>Bell is famously known for iterating on the work of the famous EPR paper, as well as finding a mistake in one of Von Neumann’s proofs. Bell’s theorem proved the nonlocal nature of Quantum Physics, thereby proving the incompleteness of the Copenhagen Interpretation. This further supports the concept of “spooky action at a distance”. <br/><br/>Bell knew that his ideas were not widely accepted and he always looked out for other physicists. On several occasions, he would ask other physicist if they were tenured before they start researching his work so as not to risk tenure-ship in the future. <br/><br/>Hugh Everett<br/>---<br/>In 1957, Hugh Everett proposed an alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation through the many worlds interpretation. This idea has been adopted by many science fiction films and implies that there is an infinite number of Universes covering all possible outcomes. This solves the Schrödinger’s cat paradox by claiming that there is one Universe where the cat lives and another where the cat dies.<br/><br/>A couple decades after Everett published his work, DeWitt published his work on quantum decoherence. Rather than having wave functions collapse, the wave function of a particle “merges” with its outer world. This, in a way, supports the many worlds interpretation.<br/><br/>Everett’s work was met with a lot of skepticism, and he never went back into academia after finishing his PhD. Instead, he started a company that consulted for the US government relating to war strategies making him quite wealthy.",,,1,0

He is not necessarily the most innovate Engineer of the 20th century, but is one of the most underrated ones. With work ranging across many different fields including information technology, genetics, electrical engineering, boolean algebra, cryptography, juggling, and more, he is the epitome of a modern polymath. Though he received a lot of fame and recognition in the academic world, he is little known by the non-academic engineering community or mainstream media.<br/><br/>Overall the book was full of interesting content, but lost my interest at certain points. I really liked learning about Shannon’s early life and history, but started losing track of what was going on when dozens of related names and events were being mentioned. Perhaps this resonates with Shannon’s life who continuously jumped from one project to another. I found the first and last thirds of the book most captivating, which corresponded to the start of Shannon’s career, as well as his retirement life. <br/><br/>Below are a few of my favorite takeaways from the book<br/><br/>Shannon’s Work<br/><br/>1. One of his most admirable traits is being able to make connections between many different fields.<br/>2. Though he liked to work independently, there were many people who helped and guided him along the way. He would not have been able to achieve what he had if others hadn’t believed in him.<br/>3. In his published work on genetics, he presented research as his own discovery even though it has already been known for a couple years. It is impressive that he single-handedly reproduced existing research within a year of entering a new field, but it also goes to show how important foundational education is.<br/>4. Alongside other mathematicians, he tried to work faster during the war in the hope that it would end the war faster.<br/>5. He fascination with Juggling during retirement fascinated me.<br/><br/>Shannon’s friends<br/><br/>1. He was friends with many notable individuals in the fields of physics and computing including John von Neumann, Alan Turing and many others. It’s astounding how a few dozen individuals in the mid 20th century shaped the whole scientific and computing world as we know it today.<br/>2. He talked to Alan Turing quite a bit, but supposedly they never discussed cryptography.<br/>3. He played chess with Garry Kasparov once. Over the years Kasparov has had to play with many amateurs, and has grown accustomed to doing so due to his fame. Most of the time he does so out of necessity, does not pay too much attention to the game, and wins within a dozen moves or so. However, in his match with Shannon, Kasparov had to concentrate, had to take the game seriously, and took 2-3 times as many moves as usual in order to win.<br/>4. Shannon was noted as a friendly individual but got frustrated and bored really easily. People who couldn’t keep up with his ideas or train of thought simply didn’t interest him. For some reason, I admire this trait.<br/>5. Earlier this year I read Edward Thorpe’s book ""A Man For All Markets"". I drew a lot of similarities between these two individuals in terms of their education, life journey and passions. I was very enthused when i found out that Claude Shannon was the person who Edward Thorpe worked with when developing his wearable technology to game the roulette. I’m sure these two men were great friends.<br/><br/>Bell Labs<br/><br/>Shannon spent a lot of time and did a lot of important work during his time at Bell Labs. This book really made me respect the company’s mission and how it was managed over the years.<br/><br/>1. During the second world war, Bell labs grew from 4600 to over 9000 individuals.<br/>2. Bell Labs was known to never pay its employees for the work they were doing, but rather pay them for the work they will do or the work they have done.<br/>3. When considering a transition from Bell Labs to MIT, Shannon was offered a higher salary. Though he chose to reject the offer, Bell Labs kept paying him for his role in perpetuity. I can’t think of any company today that would do the same.",,,1,0

Elizabeth Holmes’ life had the perfect backstory, characters and sequence of events where bright young individuals, with a passion to do good in the world get caught up in making the wrong decisions that spiral out of control.<br/><br/>With a clear linear progression, and little technical content, the audible format of this book is very easy to consume. The voice the narrator chose to use for Elizabeth throughout the book also adds an interesting element that makes you support, question and fear Elizabeth as the story progresses. You start out cheering for her as a young and helpless entrepreneur, but ultimately learn to view her as a sociopath.<br/><br/>""What would you do if you couldn’t fail?"". This book covers exactly that.<br/><br/>========<br/><br/>Elizabeth’s backstory includes an extremely successful family tree that blew away their wealth a couple generations earlier. What better driver can there be to redeem the family honor? She was always hard working, passionate and driven. Ambitious from a young age, multilingual and a Stanford student. Sounds like she was set up for success, no?<br/><br/>From afar it seems like she was doing everything right, until she wasn’t. She was following every entrepreneurial advice and self-help book that’s out on the market. She had an idol, Steve Jobs, whom she adored and tried to emulate. She always surrounded herself with people smarter and more experienced than herself. She was firm and assertive as a company executive should be. Her narrative had a longterm North Start vision from day one. She took marketing, raising money and hiring very seriously from day one. She secured the secrecy of her company’s IP which was key to securing funding for the company’s long-term success. This seems to comply with what investors like to see.<br/><br/>As an engineer, I often want to believe that ""If I build it, the users will come"". I like to believe that technology is the core piece of every business. I like to believe that design, marketing, management and a business plan is just fluff that’s superfluous to the existing technology as long as it works. However, every single post I read by investors discusses how far that is from the truth, and Elizabeth lived by that truth. The right answer is obviously that there’s a balance, but Holmes took it to the extreme and forgot that technological innovation is the root of a company that’s promising to change the world.<br/><br/>Her’s and Sunny’s naivety, lies, deception, and secrecy led to horrible company culture where everyone felt segregated and scared. Employees were not content with their technological achievement and turnover was high. Family friend relationships (The Fuisz family) were torn apart. An early employee that dedicated his life to the company committed suicide. The CEO of Safeway lost his job because of his belief in her. Investors, such as Rupert Murdock, lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Some patients were at risk of making the wrong decisions for their health. It’s ridiculous how far this lie was taken…",,,1,0

It takes a bit of time to get used to the style of “writing” in this book, but eventually you get accustomed to it. It is targeted at individuals who enjoy listening to interviews of CEOs of various tech companies, but covers a lot more history and depth than you’d be able to get anywhere else. <br/><br/>The audiobook is almost 20 hours long, but covers everything from the personal computing revolution, gaming consoles, the internet boom, the mobile revolution, and what’s to come in the next twenty years. Steve Jobs is a prominent character throughout the book, and though many have told his story through many different avenues, I still managed to learn a lot of new things about him. This book helped fill a lot of gaps in my knowledge of how Silicon Valley came to be what it is today. There were companies like General Magic that I had never heard of before, and others, like Atari, whose prominence I never fully understood. Every single chapter was equally engaging and I just couldn’t stop listening to it.<br/><br/>There was so much content in this book, that my review will never do it justice. I applaud Ben Fisher on compiling it all together in such an organized and engaging manner. In my opinion, this is the closest thing we’ll have to the “Bible of Silicon Valley”.<br/><br/>=====================<br/><br/>The Mother Of All Demos<br/><br/>A lot of people talk about the unveiling of the iPhone as a monumental moment in history, but prior to reading this book, I had never heard of the “The Mother of All Demos”. Dough Engelbart and his team built the hardware & software for a person computer with a mouse that supported live audio+video communication in 1968! This is simply astounding: https://youtu.be/yJDv-zdhzMY?t=4587<br/><br/>Alan Kay<br/><br/>When I was taking my computer languages class in College, we had a guest speaker by the name of Alan Kay. He showed us an operating system called Smalltalk where you could make changes to the OS on the fly. To be completely frank, I thought he was an old outdated Software Engineer who was stuck in the past and wasn’t willing to keep up with the future: Linux, Windows, macOS, etc… I couldn’t have been more naive. Alan Kay’s contribution during the “Mother of all demos”, the creation of OOP, his contributions at Xerox PARC, the VR scene at Atari, and much more is unspeakable. Though he’s no Steve Jobs, his contributions are equally as valuable in creating the world of computing that we have today.<br/><br/>Atari<br/><br/>As a millennial who is a tad too young to have witnessed the Atari revolution, I have always been familiar with the name but never thought too much of it. I underappreciated the importance of Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in forming the industry and culture that I have come to love. Atari was one of the first companies to allow jeans & shirts at work, flexible work hours, and unfazed by people smoking weed. The book mentions that there was one year where Atari’s revenue exceed that of all of Hollywood!<br/><br/>One fact I didn’t know prior to reading this book is that Atari invested very heavily in VR under the supervision of Alan Kay. Who knew that people thought VR was going to take off 30 years ago?<br/><br/>Activision<br/><br/>According to the book, this was the first software only company creating hundreds of software engineering millionaires. Sounds pretty common now, but someone had to be first.<br/><br/>The Well<br/><br/>Prior to Facebook there was MySpace. Prior to MySpace there was Friendster. However, no one ever talks about The WELL - the first social network on the internet launched in the mid 80s.<br/><br/>The most interesting part about The WELL is that the issues they were discussing 30 years ago are THE EXACT SAME issues people now bring up about FaceBook. Some things never change….<br/><br/>Xerox PARC<br/><br/>One of the most well known facts I knew about Xerox PARC prior to reading this book is that they created the mouse almost a decade before Steve Jobs had come in and looked at it. However, they also had an expensive personal computer, the Alto, they could’ve minaturized. They could have also been the first to have color on a personal computer. Xerox Parc could’ve easily been the Microsoft And Apple of the past three decades if they had focused on the future. Sadly, their laser printer business was so profitable that the individuals in charge just kept the status quo. I think this is a big divergence from how everyone views tech and strives for innovation in today’s world.<br/><br/>General Magic<br/><br/>As I write this, I work at a company called Magic Leap which is trying to build one of the first consumer facing Augmented Reality headsets. Some days I feel like we’re going to change the world, but others days I feel that we are a decade or two too early. Ironically, there was a company called General Magic in the early 90s which built the equivalent of an iPhone - Apps, phone, contacts, touch screen, browser, etc. Unfortunately, the “Magic” was a decade and a half too early…<br/><br/>Ebay<br/><br/>Ebay was cool when I was a kid, but someone got lost in the shadow of Amazon. This book reminded me of how dominant it once was.<br/><br/>Ebay was very much a side project for a very long time until Pierre realized he has to dedicate his full attention to it. Paul Graham says to do things that don’t scale for as long as you can, an Ebay was a prime example of that. Servers that don’t scale, accepting payments via snail mail, etc..<br/><br/>I was impressed by Ebay’s philosophy early on. The company was really trying to create a transparent and supportive community through its reputation system where everyone has an incentive to trust everyone else. It reminds me a lot about what the Blockchain industry is trying to achieve today.<br/><br/>Google<br/><br/>Google was another company where I managed to learn a lot more than expected.<br/><br/>It’s ironic to think that Larry used to spend his time writing a web crawler in Java rather than spending time doing research. Even funnier is the fact that Java was so new back then that he was running into bugs at the compiler/JVM level which a master’s student helped him fix. Furthermore, this student managed to rewrite the whole crawler in python in a weekend, making it several orders of magnitude faster, which took Larry several months to do at first.<br/><br/>I never knew too much about the dynamic between Larry and Sergei, but this book made it seem that they’re a good pair. Larry was the introverted adult with a grand vision and occasional ephinaies. Sergei was the extraverted math genius who helped bring Larry’s vision to fruition, but also needed some chaperoning. For example, Sergei realized that Larry’s original PageRank algorithm was a basic Eigen vector problem. Sergei was also known to e the one to sleep with interns during company getaways. ;)<br/><br/>To put Larry’s ideas into scope, he used to be a big proponent of the “Space Tether”. A rope connected to a space station orbiting the earth could act as an elevator into space. It’s this kind of thing that makes you realize why they thought they could tackle the autonomous car market before it went mainstream.<br/><br/>“South Beatification” of San Francisco<br/><br/>As someone who spent a few years in San Francisco, I never felt like I quite fit in. It has a lot of interesting things to see and do, but it was always too rowdy, loud, hipster and uptempo for me. South Bay has has more of a suburb, family, grad school feel which appeals to me much more. This book brings to light how these two cultures emerged.<br/><br/>San Francisco was the place where hippies got together to do drugs. The media industry set up camp in SF in the early 90s, and slowly started merging with with Silicon Valley (South Bay) during the 90s. At that point, South Bay and San Francisco turned into a a giant melting pot of tech.<br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

My respect and admiration of Ben has increased drastically after reading this book. The number of problems and hardships he experienced throughout his years as CEO must've been hard, and it is impressive how he always found a way out.<br/><br/>A lot of the lessons regarding being a CEO (i.e. how to hire execs) aren't very applicable to my day-to-day life but were interesting nonetheless. Some of the lessons can be easily extended to a manager-IC relationship. As an IC, this helped provide some perspective into how my manager and his manager might be approaching certain problems. For example, even if someone is performing very well and is asking for a raise simply to have it be matched by a competing offer, it might not always be in the best interests of the manager to match it regardless of how well the employee is performing.<br/><br/>Overall, this book is worth reading for anyone interested in the tech sector or if they have an entrepreneurial bug of any kind.",,,1,0

His deep knowledge of statistics, economics, physics and chaos theory, along with his experience in the private finance sector, as well as advising major political figures or the CIA is astounding. The way he disseminates his knowledge, shares life experiences, and analyzes the economic make this book educational, captivating and simply entertaining. There was never a dull moment, and I'm continuously amazed by how much Jim has and continues to achieve throughout his life.<br/><br/>I'll probably forget most of the details, but the book really added to my grand understanding of how the economy functions.<br/><br/>There are a few things that stood out. Being too big to fail is indeed possible, and G-SIFI is its name. World money (a global currency) is likely to appear at some point in the future, which makes me all the more bullish on Bitcoin. With that said, gold still has a place in everyone's portfolio. The chapter about LTCM's downfall really reminded me of Liar's poker and was interesting to read. He painted a good picture (no pun intended) about the importance of art in an individual's portfolio; very similar to land and gold when you look at it from a scarcity point of view.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll ever re-read this book since Jim keeps pumping out new books every year, but I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the state and history of the economy.",,,1,0

""How Asia Works"" was a little different because whenever I'd consider throwing in the towel, I would come across a very interesting concept and keep listening. However, it wasn't captivating enough to prevent me from switching to my regular podcasts every now and then.<br/><br/>The book felt very dense and long-winded. It was full of names, dates, people, places and didn't follow a chronological order.  This isn't necessarily bad but is not the best format via which I retain information. When it comes to non-technical reading, I prefer to read about grand cohesive concepts interleaved with specific examples and anecdotes. This book had too much of the latter. I would often lose focus but not be interested enough to rewind back to the part which I missed.<br/><br/>On the bright side, understanding the impact and importance of land reform and manufacturing before a country can develop to have a ""1st world economy"" is extremely interesting. I kept thinking about how big of a role it played during the fall of the Soviet Union. Seeing how I'm from Russian, I finally understood why land and houses were freely distributed to all citizens when the communist party collapsed. In a way, this gave everyone startup capital and an incentive to grow the economy further. Putin aside, I believe that the land reform that took place during the formation of Russian in the early 1990s was vital in developing its current economy.<br/><br/>Overall, this book is good but not for everyone. I wouldn't say it's a must read unless you're very interested in details of how modern Asia came to be.",,,1,0

It has easily entered into my list of top 10 favorite books of all-time, and I see myself referencing it on a periodic basis throughout the rest of my life.<br/><br/>The first half of the book is awe-inspiring as Ray Dalio shares his life story and principles. It reminded me of the need to take risk, in both life and the markets. It ignited a latent fire in me that has been cast aside. It motivated me to take on the world. Then, Dalio flipped everything upside down and showed how easily everything can come crashing down, making me fear the worst of the unknown. It was an emotional rollercoaster and I was very drawn by every word he said. His summary was very well put: you're never going to achieve anything unless you take sufficient risk, but you might also lose everything if you take on too much. Calculated risk was the key takeaway. Reading about his life was fascinating, learning about his principles was a spiritual journey, and I will gladly do so again.<br/><br/>The second half of the book was full profound knowledge, but definitely not as exciting as the first. It acts as more of a handbook which is worth reading through once, and referencing whenever a particular situation arises. I would occasionally lose interest in the sections that I hadn't personally experienced, but be invigorated as he explained his solutions to problems I've faced myself. I'm really looking forward to the apps/tools he's going to make available in the near future. I will definitely implement them myself when I start my own company.<br/><br/>Ray, thank you so much for sharing this with the world.

In my opinion, this book could serve as an fine introduction for individuals who have not studied economic bubbles, blockchain economics or the mentality required in investing. For anyone familiar with these subjects, there are many alternatives I believe are worth reading instead.<br/><br/>This book was published in 2004 and it's amazing how applicable it is to everything blockchain related today. The book argues for the needs of ""free"" (decentralized?) prediction markets on different scales: small groups, institutions, industries and the public as a whole. The book also discusses various situations where decentralized groups of individuals managed to come to a consensus under very different circumstances. It’s a bit ironic how Surowiecki makes a lot of arguments in favor of decentralized governments while also explaining how illogical economic bubbles given the speculative state of cryptocurrencies today.<br/><br/>There were some interesting references including Gary Shilling’s work, how several teams coordinated to develop a vaccine to SARS, the 1950s bowling bubble I wasn’t aware about at all, and a few economic tests run in University classes. Alongside the interesting examples, there were many mundane examples that almost put me to sleep, such as how humans coordinate through traffic amongst themselves.<br/><br/>The book is very forward-looking given that it was written before conversations of workplace diversity spread widely, and long before blockchain technology became mainstream. That being said, I do not believe it will stand the test of time because the same topics have been covered numerous times with a lot more interesting detail.",,,1,0

It was a good long-term history lesson that concentrated on the last century, which is both the one I'm most interested in and the one I can relate to the most.<br/><br/>I'm extremely impressed by how William Strauss was able to predict the financial crisis. However, it's also worth mentioning that he made many other predictions that I simply overlooked. I found myself clinging to and appreciating the predictions that came to fruition while overlooking the ones that did not. <br/><br/>Whether or not the 80 year cycles he's referring to are true or will continue, the book still provides a very good overview of the generational differences in the US population since the second world war. This is a very important narrative in understanding how the US got to where it is today.<br/><br/>The reason for the low rating is because there are tons of predictions being made, and when you make a lot of guesses, some are bound to happen. I also found that the last 20% of the book felt like continuous reiteration of ideas he had already discussed.<br/><br/>An interesting point he made is that we should expect a somewhat absurd (I do not recall the exact wording) president about 10 years after the crisis of the fourth turning; I will just leave it at that. He also mentioned that around the year 2020 is when the fourth turning should reach a climax which could potentially culminate in some sort of war. With all the debt that has been created through QE, continuously low-interest rates, Brexit, Trump, Putin, conflicts in the middle east, the rise of cryptocurrencies, and North Korea testing intercontinental ballistic missiles, I both fear but am also really excited to live through and impact what happens next.",,,1,0

Even though the audiobook is about 10 hours long, I must have spent at least 14 hours listening to it because of how frequently I had swipe back through some sections.<br/><br/>After listening to James Rickards on TIP (The Investor's Podcast) a couple items, I had to read this book because hearing him speak shows how knowledgeable and experienced he is. If you are the least bit interested in economics, I absolutely recommend this book!<br/><br/>I'm somewhat interested in politics & history, but economics is still what gages my interest. This book is perfect since it explores politics & history from an economics point of view. It was therefore a very engaging and informative read. Starting with the 1900s, it explores how the gold standard has changed, the impact that WWI and WWII had on world economics, and where paper money is today. Russian, China and the US are the primary figured focused on, with the UK and Germany also playing an important role in the first half of the 20th century.<br/><br/>James Rickards is a bit advocate of the gold standard, but I'm still not convinced. I understand the need to have currencies being pegged to some reserve, but it doesn't necessary need to be gold. All that's needed is a very strict financial policy that cannot be malformed. In my opinion, this can be done using cryptocurrencies and a DAO, which is where the world is heading.<br/><br/>James did a really good job at explaining the role of gold, the fed, the IMF & SDRs, the benefit of devaluing one's currency and floating vs fixed exchange rates.

Most importantly, it was praised by Charlie Munger in one of his recent articles which made me decided to finally give it a listen.<br/><br/>This book has a lot of interesting historical information, a lot of good anecdotes, and is filled with a plethora of good lessons. However, like anything in life, there isn't a one fits all solution. The author is delivers the philosophy in the book as if it's only right approach to life. While I will incorporate a few of the lessons I learnt, I don't think that following all of them on a day-to-day basis would jive with my personality.<br/><br/>I, like most people, am motivated by success but have always hated when my achievements are being praised. I aim to be #1, and have always thought that comparing one's self against those around me, the ""average folk"", is silly. Graduating top of your class, winning a local competition of some sort or being the strongest guy at the gym is nothing to be proud off. It's a milestone that should be acknowledged, and then it's time to move on. In my opinion, people should find a handful of people who are the best at something in the word and strive to beat them. Only that handful of individuals are the ones the matter. Though I have no proof, I am quite sure that those people are fueled by self sustaining ambition, not by the praise they receive by people around them.<br/><br/>Dale Carnegie mentions the support that people need when they have failed to achieve something. For me, failure has always been the strongest driving force to work harder. I've always hated the small talk or bloated conversation that nothing comes out of as people try to verbally support each other. It's all talk, with no walk. Failing to solve a problem, being criticized, condemned or losing an argument is what makes me want to go back home and really think about a problem. As a child, getting spanked is what made me obedient rather than playing some clever tricks. A conversation that ends on a good note is often forgotten, it's the difficult ones that we never forget.<br/><br/>Being friendly and listening to what others have to say is a very good lesson, but only if the other person is saying something mutually beneficial. I've found myself in many situations where I waste an hour listening to someone discuss a topic that nothing useful or interesting will come out of. This is extremely particularly frustrating as an impatient person.impatient.<br/><br/>Having studied a lot successful entrepreneurs (Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Young Bill Gates, etc...), I've noticed that most of them are not very empathetic early in their careers. As their klout grew it becomes easier to be empathetic because people are more likely to listen to what they have to say, but early on, direct orders are often a better means than suggestions.<br/><br/>There are counter arguments I can think of to most of the lesson Dale points out. I understand that some people have follow them to a tee and successfully influence people, but it would be unsustainable for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this book is definitely worth reading. There are at least a few lessons anyone can take away, but I would recommend to do so with a grain of salt. I was content with how it was written, but did find that it got a bit repetitive towards the end.<br/>",,,1,0

He touches on all the topics I'm interested in; including cryptography during roman times, the dark ages, renaissance, the great wars and most recently during the growth of the internet. He describes concepts with sufficient brevity such that I'm never lost or bored, but with enough technical details such that my intellectual curiosity is satisfied; there's always the appendix if the main text is not enough. His writing is very clear and conscience making it a very simple and fluid read, but I still feel as though I become a better reader and writer due to the discrepancy in our literary abilities. Overall, I just love reading his books. <br/><br/>My favorite part was definitely the section about internet cryptography, diffie-hellman and RSA public key cryptography. These were all concepts I was familiar with, but this text brought a lot of clarity to it in terms of how it's implemented, how it works, and I really enjoyed reading about the history behind how these algorithms were created and the people who created them. In particular, I also loved that he shed light on Ellis at GCHQ. I had also known for quite a while that quantum computers could brake our cryptography but never understood why until reading this book. I loved every bit of it.<br/><br/>That being said, everything from how Egyptian hieroglyphics were being deciphered, to the Rosetta Stone, the various cyphers (monoalphabetic, enigma, vigenere) all have fascinating stories and histories behind them. Small things like knowing that the decipherment of the enigma machine started in Poland, and Alan Turing based his grand ideas on the work of previous cryptoanalysts. Or the fact the Beal ciphers had never been deciphered and gold may still be lying around. Perhaps that the young professor (whose name escapes me) was so excited by his decipherment of Egyptian text he fainted. It's also hard to believe that in the 1970s, there were messengers flying around the world delivering keys because there was no other way to exchange keys. All of this is extremely interesting, and it's amazing to see how far we've come and see the path we took to get there.<br/><br/>Thank you for putting this together Simon!",,,1,0

As a software engineer with a decent background in mathematics, this book still managed to quench my thirst for some fun mathematical puzzles. I would always pause and think about the problems proposed as they came up throughout the text and have a lot of fun reading the Appendix to see how my solution, if I had one, compared.<br/><br/>There was just enough technicality to keep me interested, but never too much so that I drift off into a sense of lull due to a lack of understanding. Both math and history lectures often tend to be very dense with equations, numbers, dates and names so as to cover everything. This book provided just enough detail so one concept can be linked to another, but never so much that the reader is overwhelmed by a series of factoids.<br/><br/>Starting from ancient Greece with Pythagoras, Archimedes and Euclid, through the wars that brought on the dark ages during which the eastern world made slow but steady progress, and ultimately to the Renaissance, modern period and the 20th century, this book covered it all. While I definitely can't claim to remember all the individuals discussed, or their role in the evolution of number theory, there were a lot of events that definitely stood out. Just like a mathematical proof, this book made very logical steps in the subject manner discussed.<br/><br/>Fermat's last theorem, and number theory as a whole, really is a story of love, war, inspiration, dedication and so much more. Mathematics had promised solutions to problems and a better life, but it was overshadowed by religion for a very long time. There were many individuals who dedicated their life solely towards rigorous mathematical proofs such that those who follow can build on their work. Friendships were built. Relationships fell apart. Riots broke out. Politics got in the way. However, in the end, it always boiled down to elegant, concise, clear and beautiful mathematics. <br/><br/>This book covers a timeline of key events that shape the math we have accessible today.

For anyone who is a Michael Lewis fan, interested in economics, or has the faintest curiosity regarding what happened during the financial crisis, there is no better resource than this.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough and had the pleasure to read this book almost immediately after I read Liar's poker. For books that were written almost two decades apart, I felt like there was almost no interruption, but just a short break, between two episodes of a single story that smoothly transitioned to a fast forwarded time frame. I felt as if I was immediately immersed back into the world of Wall Street with the help of Michael Lewis' prologue, in a tone I've grown to admire, respect and trust. <br/><br/>This time around, Michael Lewis did not have the benefit of having a first-hand experience of being inside the Doomsday Machine as events unfolded. Fortunately, individuals like Steve Eisman and Michael Burry, along with other members of Scion Capital, Frontpoint Partners, and Cornwall Capital Management opened a door to their lives from the early 2000s until the collapse of the market around mid 2008. I really did feel like I was inside the Doomsday Machine, seeing the gears grind and hearing the clock tick as events unfolded.<br/><br/>This book reads very easily and feels like an entertaining fiction most of the time. It flows very well flow one concept to another, one character's plot to another, and draws implicit connections between unrelated events. This is no sheer coincidence, it's Michael Lewis brilliant writing at work. While it does read like fiction, the best part is that it's not! Real, historic, accountable events are turned into fascinating stories. The book taught me so much about the lending & borrowing market, bonds, mortgages, CDOs, CDSs, ratings, and much more. After reading this book, I can name all the major Wall Street banks of the top of my head. I almost feel as if I am a knowledgeable insider, yet I was simply reading a book on the bus.<br/><br/>The biggest life lesson to take away from this book is that the world we live in is unsupervised. While the government did come in and bail out a lot of the banks, the book still showed that no one knew what they were doing for a very long time. Even Mike Burry didn't realize he was feeding the beast itself. Those inside Wall Street, and those on the sidelines, are just as likely to make the right calls. The lesson is to always be logical, smart, realistic, and dig deep until there is no more digging to do. Most importantly though: don't fuck up the economic system. It was, is, and probably will be for the near future, in a very fragile state.<br/><br/>Thank you so much, Michael, and all the individuals you mentioned in your Acknowledgments section, for putting this together.

While I have to admit guilty to being very motivated, driven and impressed by people who’s success is of his caliber, it is the passion with which he delivers the purpose of the book that intrigues me. You can tell that he enjoys what he truly loves what he does, and for that reason I want to listen to what he has to say and learn from his breadth of experience.<br/><br/>The book start off with a couple anecdotes of the success of the methodology being described to immediately captivate the audience. When you hear of a robot company, Savioke, that delivers a toothbrush straight to the door of your hotel, and proceeds to do a happy dance, how do you not want to keep reading? Whether you are in tech or not, this short success story immediately makes you wonder how you can achieve something similar. Like the people behind the cameras during the experiment, you can tell that Jake was rooting for every member of that team, and by proxy, so is the reader. <br/><br/>Whether you are interested in robotics, brewing coffee, fitness, communication at work or medicine, Jake did a great job and using examples from a great variety of examples so as to appeal to readers of various backgrounds. I would go so far as saying that this is a must read for anyone who enjoys solving problems in our outside of work. Managers, designers, engineers and pretty much anyone from any other profession would benefit from the whole and individual concepts taught throughout the book.<br/><br/>It is extremely easy to read, and has a very good flow so it’s easy to follow. The book itself felt like a sprint as the facilitator, the author, took you into a book-long meeting, and made you question how you ever resolved anything at work in the past. It was the perfect mix of prefacing every problem with sufficient reasoning for it to require a solution, showing several alternative solutions that one could follow without facing the paradox of choice, and inserting real life examples exactly when they were needed.<br/><br/>As I was reading about the various methods to identify problems or iterate on solutions, all I could think of was how I could apply it in my workplace. As I was reading about the various success or failure stories, I kept making mental notes of dos and dont’s, while also being motivated to reach the same spot as all these other individuals have in the past.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed was a very interesting and consistent mix of gender references. I applaud Jake for not introducing gender biases and always referring to one party (i.e. the interviewer) by one gender and another (i.e. the interviewee) by another. This may it very easy to differentiate who he was referring to, and eliminated gender bias.<br/><br/>This book was absolutely entertaining, educational and even exhilarating at some points. I can’t wait to find myself in the situation where my team and I will need to go through a whole sprint so I can experience everything myself. In addition to the clear and succinct writing, Jake was kind enough to summarize everything in the end so no one ever has an excuse to not follow everything step by step.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for sharing this book with the world. A MUST read for sure.",,,1,0

It was written in a very novel way, that varied between first person and third person writing styles, and it still amazes me that everything is based on true historical events.<br/><br/>This book contains a very good historical account of exactly what happened at Salomon brothers in the late 70s and 80s. Lewis Ranieri’s rise and fall, along with mortgage bond market. The precedence of Junk Bonds. The crash of the late 80s. Relationships between a trader and his client, a trader and his rabbis, between members of the same company, or even different companies. This book was extremely educational while maintaining a great sense of excitement and intrigue throughout. There was definitely never a dull moment. I loved reading about the back and from row student’s in the training class as much as I did about John Gutfreund battle with Michael Milken.<br/><br/>Most importantly, this book was not simply a historical regurgitation of various events, nor was it just an individual’s recollection of their time in the company, it was an amalgamation of an insider’s opinion, experience and point of view as he takes you on a journey through one of the most exciting times on Wall Street.

Randomness is what guides the character from one spot to another. Weird shit happens and he just deals with it. There’s no innate meaning, or some high moral lessons to take away. This book is just about taking science fiction to the extreme, and challenging the most outrageous ideas you think you may have had with even more ridiculous ones.<br/><br/>I recommend to save this book for a very late night, an “adjusted” mindset, or when you simply want to relax while reading.

Jumping from a sequence of short, concise, direct sequences to extremely long winded stream-of-consciousness thoughts that were sometimes hard to follow but very appropriate for the book's protagonist. Whether it was a simple anecdote, a dialogue, or a poem I didn't comprehend the full meaning of, I was always impressed at how Nobokov chose to deliver various scenes in the book.<br/><br/>When my friend recommended me this book, he told me that it provides a firsthand view into the mind of a psychopath.

Reiterating concepts of fundamental analysis including key ratios and discount cash flow, this book delivered the basics of value investing in a very concise manner. Aside from reviewing basic principles, and hearing the opinion of another experienced investor on this manner, there were two factors I that I appreciated in Klarman's book: emphasis on net working and liquid capital, and his lack of disdain towards taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.<br/><br/>Buffet often speaks of only investing for the very long term in companies that have a very strong long-term track record. Companies are evaluated based on stability, consistency, growth and expectations from a product and financial perspective. However, two complicated questions are deciding when to buy and when to sell. When is a company undervalued? When is it not? How much should it be undervalued? By analyzing junk bonds, fallen angels, companies filing or on the verge of bankruptcy, it becomes very clear if a company is indeed undervalued if its assets were liquidized and when a buy is ""obvious"". Klarman's discussion of net working capital reminded me to always look at the most recent balance sheet and cash flow statement to see what the state of the company is, and what exactly I'm paying for.<br/><br/>Klarman's second point, though may potentially be indirect, is taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities. If a company is on the brink of bankruptcy, and is bound to shut down in a matter of years, it will most likely attempt to return as much cash as it can to its shareholders. Such opportunities may not be feasible long-term investments, but can produce very favorable short-term returns, and are definitely worth investigating.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this is an amazing book that's backed by a lot of experience. There is a lot to take away given how short it is, and I personally know that it made me a more disciplined and vigilant investor. Definitely a must read for any investor.",,,1,0

However, I'm going to be a hypocrite and say that it's the only reason to read this book for someone who is at least semi-familiar with value investing.<br/><br/>Benjamin Graham last edited this book in the early 1970s making a lot of the information in the text outdated. I strongly believe that the historical information discussed is extremely valuable. History always repeats itself, so knowing how the market behaved in the past provides great insight and similarities into how the market behaves now, and how it will behave in the future. People tend to get caught up in the ongoing bull / bear market, making it seem as if there had never been one like it before. Therefore, the insight Graham provides from his own viewpoint is invaluable. While it is very educational, Graham is not a very succinct writer, which is a quality I would have hoped he possess when writing a book that should also act as a reference. In addition, several of the topics (the names of which escape me now) discussed are either no longer relevant today or not relevant to 90% of the people reading this book: the general intelligent investor. Together, combining long-winded sentences with irrelevant topics, it was definitely a tough read.<br/><br/>Unless this is the first book you're reading as you do get into risk analysis, it won't teach you any new techniques or concepts that you haven't heard before. There are plenty of other resources (books, videos, etc...) I could recommend which could transcend the same knowledge in a much more concise matter.<br/><br/>I would say that this book is not worth reading unless you read the revised version, edited by Jason Zweig around 2003, which compares the concepts and situations outlaid by Graham in a post dot-com bubble era. Zweig does an outstanding job and modernizing (for the time) Graham's words, finding very interesting analogies between companies that existed in the 1960s and around 2000, while remaining very clear and succinct. I would argue that he is a much better write than Graham, but his job was easier as a commentator rather than being the one responsible for writing the meat of the text.<br/><br/>The main thing you will get out of this book is interesting historical context, the credibility of someone who can say they read this book, and just the satisfaction that you learned about value investing from Buffet's coach, the man who essentially founded this science.",,,1,0

Don’t just blindly follow the crowd assuming your dreams are out of reach, and don’t just settle for a comfortable life because it’s easy. You must push yourself outside of your comfort zone. You must be willing to make sacrifices. You must be ready to fall down. But, most importantly, you must keep your eyes on the prize and simply keep on going. Persistence, candidness, fear, confidence are just a few of the qualities you need to achieve your dream, but are only second to realizing what you dreams really are.  <br/><br/>The book itself is very short, constructed of concise and succinct sentences, with a very good flow. One could argue that the writing style is a depiction of the protagonist’s laconic character. It was very motivation, inspiring and emotional. A must read for everyone.<br/><br/>Maktub.",,,1,0
369751,The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market,Pat Dorsey,"Dorsey, Pat",Joe Mansueto,"=""0471686174""","=""9780471686170""",5,4.38,Wiley,Paperback,384,2004,2003,2015/05/21,2015/05/01,,,read,"Amazing book for beginners! <br/><br/>This book was recommended to me by a colleague after I showed some interest in stock investing. Prior to reading this book, I knew practically nothing about businesses or the market at all. I had no clue what an index was, or what equity, assets or liabilities are. On my own time I would follow the stock price of some companies that were always under the highlight (apple, google, facebook, tesla) and imagine what would happen if I were to speculate and try to beat the market. Oh, how naive I was....<br/><br/>Pat Dorsey introduced me to a whole other world that I didn't even know existed. I learnt what the purpose of stocks and the market really is. Why people invest, and why they don't. I learnt that this isn't just a game where one gets lucky by stealing or outsmarting the other person by properly timing his buy/sell, but that stock investing is actually a science. Though there are assumptions and speculations one needs to consider, there are objectively bad right and wrong decisions that one could make. It is difficult to express how excited I was about applying the lessons I learnt from this book to the real world, but I need to remember that patience is virtue. <br/><br/>In this book, I learnt about the inner workings of a company and it's management. I learnt about how finances are tracked. Most importantly, I learnt how to identify and evaluate good businesses. Seeing how stocks are always in the news, and that we all work for companies which are valued at something, regardless of whether they are public or private, I have gained a lot of insight into the world around me. In addition to learn a useful skill of what I should do with money, I also learnt how the company I work at operates, and believe that the skills I gained may also be very beneficial in the future if I choose to pursue entrepreneurship. <br/><br/>I've always had a keen interest as to how companies function, but never knew how to act on this impulse. While reading this book, I started watching videos on youtube, reading various articles, and just browsing investopedia to educate myself furthermore. I realize that this is just the beginning, but it ignited a spark that has turned into a roaring flame.<br/><br/>Some parts of the book I very dense, and even though I took my time reading through it, I still couldn't retain everything I learnt. That being said, it was written in such a way that I could use it as a reference until I familiarize myself very well with all the concepts it discusses. And if not, then the foundation that it has set up is priceless.<br/><br/>Even though this book is a little outdated given how much our economy has changed over the past 12 years, I still think that it's a must for anyone who is interested in learning about stock investing but knows nothing about it.",,,1,0

Don’t even bother picking this up if a question along the lines of ""how did the Universe come to exist"" does not cross your mind on a semi-regular basis, because I can assure you that you won’t make it even halfway through.<br/><br/>This book gave me a real appreciation, and what I would say is an admirable high level understanding of general relativity and quantum physics. These concepts are underlined and reiterated so often, that by the end of the book, the classical newtonian physics we were taught in high school almost feels like a joke and a mockery to “real” Physics; though Newton's Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica still stands as one of the most important scientific publication of all time. It provides enough context to sustain a conversation with a professional in the field of physics, to watch videos presented by today’s leaders in this field, or to even pursue a more technical reading if this book did not quench your hunger for knowledge.<br/><br/>While Hawking did a great in consolidating various principles and theories into a structured novel, he has a tendency to slide off on a tangent every so often. And while these tangents could be entertaining when they are anecdotal, they sometimes cause you to lose focus and understanding of the subject at hand. There’s a lot of jumping back and forth and referencing between different chapters as he is clearly trying show how all the different concepts fit into a single greater picture, but this approach is not effective the whole way through. While most of explanations are full of pithy, and he only expounds on certain points when necessary, using very straightforward analogies, there were a couple moments where Hawking skimmed over a pretty difficult concept and assumed that the reader had a full understanding of it moving forward.<br/><br/>Though I do come from a technical engineering background, the lack of math in this book is very comforting. I loved learning philosophical theories just as the anthropic principles, and about qualitative observations such as Feynman’s rules. However, being able to understand the Chandrasekhar limit, and what differentiates a white dwarf, neutron star and a black whole without delving into the math was what this book was made for. Knowing that the final structure of a black whole is SOLELY dependent on the original planet’s mass and rotation was almost euphoric. Trying to understand the idea of dark matter, antiparticles, and negative energy was a great thought experiment as well, though it is something I would like to revisit at some point in the future. Stephen hawking knew exactly what this book should contain, and how much detail it should have, and for that I admire him.<br/><br/>There were a couple chapters I had to reread because halfway through because they flew over my head the first time, so I can safely say that this is one of the few books I may need to read more than twice.",,,1,0

However, this was achieved at the cost of character depth which this book didn’t even come close to addressing. There was no more to the story than meets the eye; what you see is all there is. That being said, certain parts were very captivating because of the risk associated with Mark Watney’s survival, but it was quickly dissolved into the outer void. <br/><br/>I appreciated Weir’s effort for being very detailed with how Nasa functions and the type of equipment that was available on Mars, though I can’t speak for how scientifically accurate it was (or will be).<br/><br/>Overall, I was a little disappointed with this book because all I took away from it is what I would get from one episode of Man vs. Wild; which is still something at the end of the day. I expect the film adaptation to be pretty good, given that Matt Damon is playing the lead, and believe that this is one of those books where the film will be good enough not to read the book.",,,1,0

I heard that it was written by the president of Pixar, and was aware that the infamous Steve Jobs played some role in founding it, but I really didn't know much more than that. I had no idea what to expect from this book but I knew that I loved Pixar movies, so picking up this book couldn't have been that bad of a decision. In fact, it was a great decision!<br/><br/>As someone whose whole childhood revolved around Disney movies during their golden years, I was able to instantly connect with Ed. That warm bliss I so fondly recall from rewatching The Lion King, Mulan, Hercules, The Beauty and The Beast (just to name a few) doesn't compare to any other childhood memory I have. The flawless drawings driven by the heart felt story draws you in and takes you to a whole new world (yes, that's an Aladdin reference).<br/><br/>I have also always been fascinated by graphics and animations. Never a big gamer, but always interested in seeing what kind of games are out, or what kind of 3D worlds there are to explore. I never really understood the technology that made it possible, but I loved observing the results. When I first started taking Computer Science courses in high school, I kind of went overboard with my animations. Though they weren't very appealing, I just hungered for more when I saw what kind of dynamic animations a few lines of code could produce.<br/><br/>Though I got a little of topic, I think the paragraph above is a good depiction of the context that Ed had set up in his book. Even though him and I are a generation apart, I was able to very easily connect with him through his writing, which made the rest of the book a lot more personal. Bottom line is that if you are a Disney fan who is interested in graphics, calling this book a ""must read"" would be an understatement.<br/><br/>Ed discusses his academic career and achievements, very modestly, touching up on technical details very superficially while trying not to overwhelm his non-technical audience, and not to bore most of the other readers. His use of personal anecdotes and what seems like complete honesty helps you both understand and believe what he is saying. Rather than just taking his word, he is able to convince you without directly imposing his ideas.<br/><br/>I won't go into any details, but I will just say that the lessons one can take away from this book are priceless. You can see how the techniques he lists were formed, how they have evolved, and how people react to them. On numerous occasions, Ed answered a question or addressed a thought I had on the next page.<br/><br/>Ed also discussed what it's been like to work with Steve Jobs for over a quarter of a century. He is one of the few people in the world who knew Steve that well on both a personal and a professional level, so getting a first hand insight into the kind of man that Steve was, and how he changed over the years, was really eye-opening.<br/><br/>This book is extremely inspiring! It provides you with a really good insight of what a great workplace could be like, and explains how it is an ever-changing target that can never been achieved. There were many amazing ideas on how to lead a team and a company, how to be a better colleague, how to better work with your colleagues, how to find your passion, and how to really get better at what you do while enjoying it! I consider myself to be a little biased reviewing this book because the transparency Ed described in this book is very close to how Twitter functions now adays, but I loved every page nonetheless.<br/>",,,1,0

It takes you on a long journey with two protagonists whose lives are entangled in the strangest ways. They are very simple from a superficial standpoint, but I imagine them to be more like a rose growing of a ground covered with snow. Very simple and elegant with little to their complexity, but very fragile, out of place and temporary.<br/><br/>Murukami aced it. There is never too much detail, and there is never a lack of it either. Much like the characters he depicts in the novel who never say a word in excess, Murukami does the same in the way he writes. He lures you in, and makes you wonder. He makes you question your surroundings. He makes you question your values. He makes you think back to your first memory, and forces you to re-evaluate the present, while disregarding the future.<br/><br/>It's difficult to separate what his characters are imagining versus what they are experiencing. Is anything really happening? Murukami is treading in very thin water, on a very fine, in every chapter, on every page, in every line. The novel was just a love story, but for what purpose, and at what costs? It's hard not to bond with his characters, and I kept seeing more and more of myself in them as I kept on reading. <br/><br/>This novel was a passageway of sorts, that lured me into a different way of thinking, without a way back. So here I am, stranded, writing this review, with the moon hanging in the sky outside my window.",,,1,0
